<h1>Build Gradle from the source</h1>

<h2>Get the sources</h2>
Either download the <a href="gradle-${currentRelease}-src.zip">source distribution</a> or <a href="source-repository.html">check out Gradle from git.</a>

<h2>Execute the Build</h2>
We use Gradle to build Gradle. But Gradle does not need to be installed on your machine to build it. The source
tree contains a Gradle binary distribution capable of building Gradle. With the Gradle wrapper you can
build Gradle via this internal Gradle distribution. Just go to the top level directory of the source tree and type:<br/><br/>
Windows:
<pre>
    gradlew clean dists
</pre>

*nix:
<pre>
    ./gradlew clean dists
</pre>
<p>
In the <code>build/distributions</code> folder you can find the generated Gradle distributions. Note that you will
need internet access the first time you run this, as the Gradle wrapper will download a number of dependencies the
first time it runs.
</p>
The Gradle build is usually an early adopter of new Gradle features. If you want to build HEAD, it is therefore likely
that you won't be able to build it with the last Gradle release. But you can simply use the wrapper scripts as
described above.
<p>
To learn more about the Gradle wrapper and how you can use it for your own projects build with Gradle have a look at
the <a href="userguide.html">user guide</a>.

<h2>Installing Gradle with the Build</h2>
The Gradle build has an install task:
<pre>
    ./gradlew clean install -Pgradle_installPath=<i>someDir</i>
</pre>
<p>The install task deletes any existing Gradle distribution at the specified destination. You specify the install
destination with the <code>gradle_installPath</code> property. This property is interpreted relative to the
source directory.</p>
        
<p>You can set this property in the <code>gradle.properties</code> file of your Gradle home directory (usually
<code><i>USER_HOME</i>/.gradle</code>). For how to set project properties you may have a look at the
<a href="userguide.html">user guide</a>.</p>
