<h1>Build Gradle from the source</h1>

<h2>Get the sources</h2>
Either download the <a href="gradle-${currentRelease}-src.zip">source distribution</a> or <a href="source-repository.html">check out Gradle from svn.</a>

<h2>Execute the Build</h2>
We use Gradle to build Gradle. But Gradle does not need to be installed on your machine to build it. Svn and the
source distribution contain a Gradle binary distribution capable of building Gradle. With the Gradle wrapper you can
build Gradle via this internal Gradle distribution. Just go to the top level directory of the svn checkout or the Gradle
source distribution and type:<br/><br/>
Windows:
<pre>
    gradlew clean dists
</pre>

*nix:
<pre>
    ./gradlew clean dists
</pre>
<p>
In the <code>build/distributions</code> folder you can find the generated Gradle distributions.     
</p>
The Gradle build is usually an early adopter of new Gradle features. If you want to build HEAD,
it is therefore not unlikely that you can't build it with the last Gradle release. But you can simply use the wrapper
scripts as described above.
<p>
To learn more about the Gradle wrapper and how you can use it for your own projects build with Gradle have a look at
the <a href="userguide.html">user guide</a>.
</p>
<h2>Installing Gradle with the Build</h2>
The Gradle build has an install task:
<pre>
    ./gradlew clean install
</pre>
<p>The install task deletes any existing Gradle distribution at the specified destination. You need to specify the
install destinaton with the <code>gradle_installPath</code> property. This property is interpreted relative to the
source directory.</p>
        
<p>You can set this property in the <code>gradle.properties</code> file of your Gradle home directory (usually
<code>USER_HOME/.gradle</code>). For how to set project properties you may have a look at the
<a href="userguide.html">user guide</a>.</p>
