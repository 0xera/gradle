Gradle Script Kotlin 0.1.1 Release Notes
========================================

_**UPDATE 2016.06.20**: Gradle Script Kotlin version `1.0 M1a` has been renamed to version `0.1.1`. This change is being made to accommodate more frequent feature and patch releases on the road to `1.0` GA. Note that names and versions of published artifacts have not changed. Only the tag and release notes themselves have been updated for consistency and continuity with future `0.*` pre-releases._


General Notes
-------------

This patch release upgrades Gradle Script Kotlin's dependency on `org.jetbrains:kotlin-compiler-embeddable` from `1.1.0-dev-372` to `1.1.0-dev-372a`. The latter is our own custom patch that removes a problematic `META-INF/services` file from the jar that causes failures at Gradle runtime.

This release should be used in favor of `0.1.0` in all cases, and all the features and limitations detailed in the original [`0.1.0` release notes][1] still apply.

Fixes since 0.1.0
