= Implementing Plugins

While there are three types of plugins -- script, pre-compiled script, or binary plugins -- there are also many languages available for implementing each type of plugin.
Only a few options are recommended:

[cols="~,~,~,~,~,~"]
|===
|*#* |*Using:* |*Type:* |*The Plugin is:* |*Created by applying:* |*Use?*

|1
|Kotlin DSL
|Script
|in a `.gradle.kts` file as an abstract class that implements the `apply(Project project)` method of the `Plugin<Project>` interface.
|
|Nofootnote:1[<<custom_plugins#sec:build_script_plugins,*Script plugins*>> are hard to maintain, test, and do not support defining new reusable types. They are not recommended.]

|2
|Kotlin DSL
|Pre-compiled script
|a `.gradle.kts` file
|`id("kotlin-dsl")`
|Yesfootnote:3[It is recommended to use a statically-typed language like *Java* or *Kotlin* for implementing plugins to reduce the likelihood of binary incompatibilities. If using Groovy, consider using `@groovy.transform.CompileStatic`.]

|3
|Kotlin DSL
|Binary
|a `.gradle.kts` file
|`id("kotlin-dsl")` +
`id("com.gradle.plugin-publish")`
|Yesfootnote:3[]

|4
|Groovy DSL
|Script
|in a `.gradle` file as an abstract class that implements the `apply(Project project)` method of the `Plugin<Project>` interface.
|
|Nofootnote:1[]

|5
|Groovy DSL
|Pre-compiled script
|a `.gradle` file
|`id("groovy-gradle-plugin")`
|Nofootnote:2[<<custom_plugins#sec:precompile_script_plugin,*Pre-compiled script*>> plugins are best used as <<custom_plugins#sec:convention_plugins,*convention plugins*>> written in Kotlin DSL or Java.]

|6
|Groovy DSL
|Binary
|a `.gradle` file
|`id("groovy-gradle-plugin")` +
`id("com.gradle.plugin-publish")`
|Nofootnote:3[]

|7
|Java
|Pre-compiled script
|an abstract class that implements the `apply(Project project)` method of the `Plugin<Project>` interface.
|`id("java-gradle-plugin")`
|Yesfootnote:2[]

|8
|Java
|Binary
|an abstract class that implements the `apply(Project project)` method of the `Plugin<Project>` interface.
|`id("java-gradle-plugin")` +
`id("com.gradle.plugin-publish")`
|Yesfootnote:3[<<custom_plugins#sec:custom_plugins_standalone_project,*Binary plugins*>> should be used when logic needs to be shared across independent projects. They allow for structuring code into classes and packages, are cacheable, support versioning, and are easily testable.]

|Kotlin
|Pre-compiled script
|an abstract class that implements the `apply(Project project)` method of the `Plugin<Project>` interface.

If you suspect issues with your plugin code, try creating a link:https://scans.gradle.com/[Build Scan] to identify bottlenecks.
The link:https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler[Gradle profiler] can help automate Build Scan generation and gather more low-level information.
