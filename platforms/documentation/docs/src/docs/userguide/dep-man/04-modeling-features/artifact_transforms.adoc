= Artifact Transforms

What if you want to adjust the JAR file of one of the dependencies before you use it?

Gradle has a built-in feature for this called **Artifact Transforms**.
With Artifact Transforms, you can modify, extend, or reduce artifacts like JAR files before tasks or tools like the IDE use it.

== Artifact Transforms Overview

Dependencies may exist with different variants (where variants are a set of attributes, i.e., key-value pairs such as `minified=true`).
When Gradle resolves a configuration, it looks at each dependency and finds its variant with the requested attributes selected.
When the dependency does not have a variant, resolving the configuration fails unless Gradle finds Artifact Transforms that can transform the dependency's artifacts into the required format (without changing its transitive dependencies).

Artifact Transforms are a mechanism for converting one type of artifact into another during the build process.
It's a more efficient and flexible way of handling dependencies by transforming the artifacts to the required format or type without needing multiple variants of the same artifact.

Artifact Transforms are a lot like tasks.
It’s a unit of work with some inputs and outputs.
Mechanisms like `UP-TO-DATE` and caching work for transforms as well.

image::artifact-transform-1.png[]

The difference between tasks and transforms is how they are scheduled and put into the chain of actions Gradle executes when a build configures and runs.
At a high level, transforms always run before tasks because they are part of the dependency resolution.
Transforms modify artifacts BEFORE they become an input to a task.

Here's a brief overview of how to create and use Artifact Transforms:

1. **Define a Transform**: You define an artifact transform by creating a class that implements the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/TransformAction.html[`TransformAction`] interface.
This class specifies how the input artifact should be transformed into the output artifact.

2. **Use Attributes**: Attributes (key-value pairs used to describe different variants of a dependency) like `org.gradle.usage=java-api` and `org.gradle.usage=java-runtime` are used to specify the desired artifact format/type.

3. **Register a Transform**: You register the transform in your build script using the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/dsl/DependencyHandler.html#registerTransform(java.lang.Class,org.gradle.api.Action)[`registerTransform()`] method of the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Project.html#dependencies(groovy.lang.Closure)[`dependencies`] configuration.
This method links the input artifact type to the output artifact type and associates it with the transform action class.

4. **Use the Transformed Artifacts**: When a task requires an artifact of the transformed type, Gradle automatically applies the registered transform to the input artifact and provides the transformed artifact to the task.

=== 1. Define a Transform

A transform is implemented as an abstract class.
The class implements the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/TransformAction.html[`TransformAction`] interface.
It can optionally have parameters defined in a separate interface.

Each transform has exactly one input artifact.
It must be annotated with the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/InputArtifact.html[`@InputArtifacts`] annotation.

Then, you implement the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/TransformAction.html#transform(org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformOutputs)[`transform()`] method from the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/TransformAction.html[`TransformAction`] interface.
This is where you implement the work the transform should do when triggered.
The method has the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/TransformOutputs.html[`TransformOutputs`] as an argument that defines what the transform produces.

Here, `MyTransform` is the custom transform action that converts a `jar` artifact to a `transformed-jar` artifact:
[source,kotlin]
----
abstract class MyTransform : TransformAction<TransformParameters.None> {
    @get:InputArtifact
    abstract val inputArtifact: Provider<FileSystemLocation>

    override fun transform(outputs: TransformOutputs) {
        val inputFile = inputArtifact.get().asFile
        val outputFile = outputs.file(inputFile.name.replace(".jar", "-transformed.jar"))
        // Perform transformation logic here
    }
}
----

=== 2. Use an Attribute

Attributes are used to determine whether an artifact transform should be run.

Here, the `implementation` dependency configuration specifies that it requires the `transformed-jar` format:

[source,kotlin]
----
dependencies {
    implementation("some:dependency") {
        attributes {
            attribute(ArtifactAttributes.ARTIFACT_FORMAT, "transformed-jar")
        }
    }
}
----

=== 3. Register a Transform

A transform must be registered the same way a task is registered using link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/dsl/DependencyHandler.html#registerTransform(java.lang.Class,org.gradle.api.Action)[`dependencies.registerTransform()`]:

Here, our transform is registered with the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Project.html#dependencies(groovy.lang.Closure)[`dependencies`] configuration:

[source,kotlin]
----
dependencies {
    registerTransform(MyTransform::class) {
        from.attribute(ArtifactAttributes.ARTIFACT_FORMAT, "jar")
        to.attribute(ArtifactAttributes.ARTIFACT_FORMAT, "transformed-jar")
    }
}
----

=== 4. Use the Transformed Artifacts

During a build, Gradle uses registered transforms to produce a required artifact if it’s not directly available.

Gradle can handle dependencies more efficiently by transforming artifacts as needed rather than relying on multiple pre-built variants.

[[sec:abm_artifact_transforms]]
== Understanding Artifact Transforms on Resolution

Dependencies can have different <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:resolvable-consumable-configs,**variants**>>, essentially different versions or forms of the same dependency.
These variants can differ based on their use cases, such as when compiling code or running applications.

image::artifact-transform-4.png[]

Let's use the following example where an external Maven dependency has two variants:

.Maven Dependencies
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Variant | Description

|`org.gradle.usage=java-api`
|Used for compiling against the dependency.

|`org.gradle.usage=java-runtime`
|Used for running an application with the dependency.
|===

And a project dependency has even more variants:

.Project Dependencies
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Variant | Description

|`org.gradle.usage=java-api`
`org.gradle.libraryelements=classes`
|Represents classes directories used for compilation.

|`org.gradle.usage=java-api`
`org.gradle.libraryelements=jar`
|Represents JAR files used for compilation.
|===

The variants of a dependency may differ in its transitive dependencies or in the artifact itself.

For example, the `java-api` and `java-runtime` variants of the Maven dependency only differ in the transitive dependencies, and both use the same artifact — the JAR file.
For the project dependency, the `java-api,classes` and the `java-api,jars` variants have the same transitive dependencies but different artifacts — the `classes` directories and the `JAR` files respectively.

=== Attributes and Variants

Each variant is identified uniquely by a set of <<variant_model.adoc#sec:abm_configuration_attributes,**attributes**>>.
Attributes are key-value pairs that describe specific characteristics of the variant.

For example, the `java-api` variant of a dependency is identified by the attribute `org.gradle.usage` with the value `java-api`.

=== Resolving Configurations

When Gradle resolves a configuration, it uses the attributes defined to select the appropriate variant of each dependency.
The attributes that Gradle uses to determine which variant to select are called the **requested attributes**.

For example, if a configuration requests `org.gradle.usage=java-api` and `org.gradle.libraryelements=classes`, Gradle will select the variant of the project dependency that matches these attributes (in this case, the `classes` directory).

=== Artifact Transforms

Sometimes, a dependency might not have the exact variant with the requested attributes.
In such cases, Gradle can transform one variant into another without changing its transitive dependencies (other dependencies it relies on).

For example, if the requested variant is `java-api,classes`, but the dependency only has `java-api,jar`, Gradle can transform the `JAR` file into a `classes` directory by unzipping it using Artifact Transforms.

Gradle allows registering Artifact Transforms.
When the dependency does not have the requested variant, Gradle will try to find a chain of Artifact Transforms to create it.

== Understanding Artifact Transforms and Attribute-Based Resolution

When Gradle resolves a configuration and a dependency does not have a variant with the requested attributes, it attempts to find a chain of Artifact Transforms to create the desired variant.
This process is called **Artifact Transform selection**:

image::artifact-transform-5.png[]

1. **Start with requested Attributes**:
- Gradle starts with the attributes specified in the configuration.
- It considers all registered transforms that modify these attributes.

2. **Find a path to existing Variants**:
- Gradle works backwards, trying to find a path from the requested attributes to an existing variant.

IMPORTANT: Gradle does not try to select Artifact Transforms when a variant of the dependency matching the requested attributes already exists.

For example, if the `minified` attribute has values `true` and `false`, and a transform can change `minified=false` to `minified=true`, Gradle will use this transform if only `minified=false` variants are available but `minified=true` is requested.

=== Selection of Transform chains

Gradle selects the best chain of transforms based on specific rules:
- If there is only one chain, it is selected.
- If one chain is a suffix of another, the more specific chain is selected.
- The shortest chain is preferred.
- If multiple chains are equally suitable, the selection fails, and an error is reported.

NOTE: The `artifactType` attribute is special because it is only present on resolved artifacts, not on dependencies. Transforms that only change `artifactType` are not considered during configuration resolution but can be used in an link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/ArtifactView.html[`ArtifactView`].

Continuing from the `minified` example above, a configuration requests `org.gradle.usage=java-runtime, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, minified=true`.
The dependencies are:

* External `guava` dependency with variants:
** `org.gradle.usage=java-runtime, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, minified=false`
** `org.gradle.usage=java-api, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, minified=false`

* Project `producer` dependency with variants:
** `org.gradle.usage=java-runtime, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, minified=false`
** `org.gradle.usage=java-runtime, org.gradle.libraryelements=classes, minified=false`
** `org.gradle.usage=java-api, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, minified=false`
** `org.gradle.usage=java-api, org.gradle.libraryelements=classes, minified=false`

Gradle uses the `minify` transform to convert `minified=false` variants to `minified=true`.

* For `guava`, Gradle converts
** `org.gradle.usage=java-runtime, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, minified=false` to
** `org.gradle.usage=java-runtime, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, minified=true`.
* For `producer`, Gradle converts
** `org.gradle.usage=java-runtime, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, minified=false` to
** `org.gradle.usage=java-runtime, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, minified=true`.

Then, during execution:

- Gradle downloads the `guava` JAR and minifies it.
- Gradle executes the `producer:jar` task to produce the JAR and then minifies it.
- These tasks are executed in parallel where possible.

To set up the `minified` attribute so that the above works, you need to register the new attribute in the schema, add it to all JAR artifacts, and request it on all resolvable configurations:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-minify/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-attribute-setup]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-minify/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-attribute-setup]"]
====
<1> Add the attribute to the schema
<2> All JAR files are not minified
<3> Request `minified=true` on all resolvable configurations
<4> Add the dependencies which will be transformed
<5> Add task that requires the transformed artifacts

You can now see what happens when we run the `resolveRuntimeClasspath` task, which resolves the `runtimeClasspath` configuration.
Gradle transforms the project dependency before the `resolveRuntimeClasspath` task starts.
Gradle transforms the binary dependencies when it executes the `resolveRuntimeClasspath` task:

$ gradle resolveRuntimeClasspath

[[sec:implementing-artifact-transforms]]
== Implementing Artifact Transforms without Parameters

Similar to task types, an artifact transform consists of an action and some parameters.
The major difference from custom task types is that the action and the parameters are implemented as two separate classes.

The implementation of the artifact transform action is a class implementing link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformAction.html[TransformAction].
You must implement the `transform()` method on the action, which converts an input artifact into zero, one, or multiple output artifacts.

Most Artifact Transforms are one-to-one, so the `transform` method will transform the input artifact into exactly one output artifact.

The implementation of the artifact transform action needs to register each output artifact by calling
link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformOutputs.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformOutputs:dir(java.lang.Object)[TransformOutputs.dir()] or link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformOutputs.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformOutputs:file(java.lang.Object)[TransformOutputs.file()].

You can supply two types of paths to the `dir` or `file` methods:

- An absolute path to the input artifact or within the input artifact (for an input directory).
- A relative path.

Gradle uses the absolute path as the location of the output artifact.
For example, if the input artifact is an exploded WAR, the transform action can call `TransformOutputs.file()` for all JAR files in the `WEB-INF/lib` directory.
The output of the transform would then be the library JARs of the web application.

For a relative path, the `dir()` or `file()` method returns a workspace to the transform action.
Implementing the transform action needs to create the transformed artifact at the location of the provided workspace.

The output artifacts replace the input artifact in the transformed variant in the order they were registered.
For example, if the configuration consists of the artifacts `lib1.jar`, `lib2.jar`, `lib3.jar`, and the transform action registers a minified output artifact `<artifact-name>-min.jar` for the input artifact, then the transformed configuration consists of the artifacts `lib1-min.jar`, `lib2-min.jar`, and `lib3-min.jar`.

Here is the implementation of an `Unzip` transform, which unzips a JAR file into a `classes` directory.
The `Unzip` transform does not require any parameters:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-unzip/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-unzip]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-unzip/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-unzip]"]
====
<1> Use `TransformParameters.None` if the transform does not use parameters
<2> Inject the input artifact
<3> Request an output location for the unzipped files
<4> Do the actual work of the transform

Note how the implementation uses `@InputArtifact` to inject the artifact to transform into the action.
It requests a directory for the unzipped classes by using `TransformOutputs.dir()` and then unzips the JAR file into this directory.

== Implementing Artifact Transforms with Parameters

An artifact transform may require parameters, such as a `String` for filtering or a file collection used to support the transformation of the input artifact.
To pass these parameters to the transform action, you must define a new type with the desired parameters.
This type must implement the marker interface link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/TransformParameters.html[TransformParameters].

The parameters must be represented using <<properties_providers.adoc#managed_properties,managed properties>> and the parameter type must be a <<properties_providers.adoc#managed_types,managed type>>.
You can use an interface or abstract class to declare the getters, and Gradle will generate the implementation.
All getters need to have proper input annotations, as described in the <<incremental_build.adoc#table:incremental_build_annotations,incremental build annotations>> table.

Here is the implementation of a `Minify` transform that makes JARs smaller by only keeping certain classes in them.
The `Minify` transform requires the classes to keep as parameters:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-minify/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-minify]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-minify/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-minify]"]
====
<1> Declare the parameter type
<2> Interface for the transform parameters
<3> Use the parameters
<4> Use the unchanged input artifact when no minification is required

Observe how you can obtain the parameters by `TransformAction.getParameters()` in the `transform()` method.
The implementation of the `transform()` method requests a location for the minified JAR by using `TransformOutputs.file()` and then creates the minified JAR at this location.

Remember that the input artifact is a dependency, which may have its own dependencies.
Suppose your artifact transform needs access to those transitive dependencies.
In that case, it can declare an abstract getter returning a `FileCollection` and annotate it with link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/InputArtifactDependencies.html[@InputArtifactDependencies].
When your transform runs, Gradle will inject the transitive dependencies into the `FileCollection` property by implementing the getter.
Note that using input artifact dependencies in a transform has performance implications; only inject them when needed.

== Implementing Artifact Transforms with Caching

Artifact Transforms can make use of the <<build_cache.adoc#build_cache,build cache>> for their outputs.

To enable the build cache for an artifact transform, add the `@link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/CacheableTransform.html[CacheableTransform]` annotation on the action class.

For cacheable transforms, you must annotate its link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/InputArtifact.html[@InputArtifact] property — and any property marked with link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/transform/InputArtifactDependencies.html[@InputArtifactDependencies] — with normalization annotations such as link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/PathSensitive.html[@PathSensitive].

The following example demonstrates a more complex transform that relocates specific classes within a JAR to a different package.
This process involves rewriting the bytecode of both the relocated classes and any classes that reference them (class relocation):

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-relocate/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-relocate]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-relocate/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-relocate]"]
====
<1> Declare the transform cacheable
<2> Interface for the transform parameters
<3> Declare input type for each parameter
<4> Declare a normalization for the input artifact
<5> Inject the input artifact dependencies
<6> Use the parameters

Note the classes to be relocated are determined by examining the packages of the input artifact and its dependencies.
Additionally, the transform ensures that packages contained in JAR files on an external classpath are not relocated.

== Implementing incremental Artifact Transforms

Similar to <<custom_tasks#incremental_tasks,incremental tasks>>, Artifact Transforms can avoid work by only processing changed files from the last execution.
This is done by using the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html[InputChanges] interface.

For Artifact Transforms, only the input artifact is an incremental input; therefore, the transform can only query for changes there.
To use link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html[InputChanges] in the transform action, inject it into the action.

For more information on how to use link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.work.InputChanges.html[InputChanges], see the corresponding documentation for <<custom_tasks#incremental_tasks,incremental tasks>>.

Here is an example of an incremental transform that counts the lines of code in Java source files:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-incremental/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-countloc]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-incremental/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-countloc]"]
====
<1> Inject `InputChanges`
<2> Query for changes in the input artifact

// TODO: https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10867
// [[artifact-resolution-queries]]
// == Artifact resolution queries

== Registering Artifact Transforms

You need to register the artifact transform actions, providing parameters if necessary so that they can be selected when resolving dependencies.

To register an artifact transform, you must use link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler:registerTransform(java.lang.Class,%20org.gradle.api.Action)[registerTransform()] within the `dependencies {}` block.

There are a few points to consider when using `registerTransform()`:

- The `from` and `to` attributes are required.
- The transform action itself can have configuration options. You can configure them with the `parameters {}` block.
- You must register the transform on the project that has the configuration that will be resolved.
- You can supply any type implementing link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformAction.html[TransformAction] to the `registerTransform()` method.

For example, imagine you want to unpack some dependencies and put the unpacked directories and files on the classpath.
You can do so by registering an artifact transform action of type `Unzip`, as shown here:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-unzip/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-unzip/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
====

Another example is that you want to minify JARs by only keeping some `class` files from them.
Note the use of the `parameters {}` block to provide the classes to keep in the minified JARs to the `Minify` transform:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-minify/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms-minify/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
====

== Executing Artifact Transforms

On the command line, Gradle runs tasks; not Artifact Transforms: `./gradlew build.`
So how and when does it run transforms?

A task can declare an input with attributes.
When running this task, Gradle may run an Artifact Transform to ensure that the input has the proper attributes.
Then, it will run the task.

There are two ways to execute a transform:

1. Artifact Transforms execution for _project dependencies_ can be discovered ahead of task execution and, therefore can be scheduled outside the task execution (as a <<build_lifecycle.adoc#sec:execution, planned transform node in the execution graph>>).
2. Artifact Transforms execution for _external module dependencies_ cannot be discovered ahead of task execution and, therefore are scheduled inside the task execution (as part of the <<build_lifecycle.adoc#sec:execution, task node in the execution graph>>).

Unlike a task, which is invoked once all its dependencies are finished executing, many tasks can request transforms at any time in the build.
Therefore, when an execution graph node or a task needs an artifact transform, it places a request.

NOTE: Transform executions don’t run as ‘children’ of execution graph nodes. Requests are the ‘children’.

Gradle will check if this request needs to be executed.
The execution engine will fulfill the request as efficiently as possible.
If the request is in the in-memory cache (daemon memory), `UP-TO-DATE`, or in the local/remove cache, Gradle will avoid executing it again.
This means that one execution of a transform can fulfill many requests.
Gradle takes full advantage of already fulfilled requests.

TIP: In well-declared builds, project dependencies can be fully discovered during task configuration ahead of task execution scheduling.
If the project dependency is badly declared (e.g., missing task input), the transform execution will happen inside the task.
What could be a planned transform node in the execution graph becomes a transform request to the parent task.
