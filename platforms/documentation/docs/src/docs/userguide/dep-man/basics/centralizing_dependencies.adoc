= 4. Centralizing dependencies

Central dependencies can be managed in Gradle using various techniques such as platforms and version catalogs.
Each approach offers its own advantages and helps in centralizing and managing dependencies efficiently.

== Using platforms

A platform is a set of dependency constraints designed to manage the transitive dependencies of a library or application.

When you define a platform in Gradle, you're essentially specifying a set of dependencies that are meant to be used together, ensuring compatibility and simplifying dependency management:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/java-platform/dep-man/kotlin/platform",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/java-platform/dep-man/groovy/platform",files="build.gradle[]"]
====

Then, you can use that platform in your project:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/java-platform/dep-man/kotlin/app",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/java-platform/dep-man/groovy/app",files="build.gradle[]"]
====

Here, `my-platform` defines versions for `moduleA` and `moduleB`, ensuring they are compatible.

Maven's BOM (Bill of Materials) is a popular type of platform that Gradle supports.
A BOM file lists dependencies with specific versions, allowing you to manage these versions in a centralized way.

A popular platform is the link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.spring.platform/platform-bom/Cairo-RELEASE[Spring IO Bill of Materials] which is maintained and hosted by link:https://spring.io/[Spring]:
To use the BOM, you add it to the dependencies of your project:

[source,kotlin]
.build.gradle.kts
----
dependencies {
    implementation platform("io.spring.platform:platform-bom:Cairo-RELEASE")
    implementation("org.springframework:spring-core")
    implementation("org.springframework:spring-context")
}
----

By including the `platform-bom`, you ensure that all Spring components use the versions defined in the BOM file.

== Using a Version catalog

A version catalog is a centralized list of dependency coordinates that can be referenced in multiple projects.
You can reference this catalog in your projects to ensure consistent version management.

First, create a `libs.versions.toml` file in the `gradle` directory of your project.
This file will define the versions of your dependencies and plugins:

[source,toml]
.gradle/libs.versions.toml
----
[versions]
guava = "30.1.1-jre"
commons-lang3 = "3.12.0"
lombok = "1.18.20"
mysql = "8.0.23"

[libraries]
guava = { module = "com.google.guava:guava", version.ref = "guava" }
commons-lang3 = { module = "org.apache.commons:commons-lang3", version.ref = "commons-lang3" }
lombok = { module = "org.projectlombok:lombok", version.ref = "lombok" }
mysql = { module = "mysql:mysql-connector-java", version.ref = "mysql" }

[plugins]
spring-boot = { id = "org.springframework.boot", version = "2.5.4" }
----

Then, you can use the version catalog in you build file:

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
   id('java')
   id('org.springframework.boot' version libs.versions.spring.boot)
}

repositories {
   mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
   implementation(libs.guava)
   implementation(libs.commons.lang3)
   compileOnly(libs.lombok)
   runtimeOnly(libs.mysql)
}
----
