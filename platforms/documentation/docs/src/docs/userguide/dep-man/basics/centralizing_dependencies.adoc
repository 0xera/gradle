= 4. Centralizing dependencies

== Understanding dependency centralization
Central dependencies can be managed in Gradle using various techniques such as a lockfile, version catalog, and convention plugins. Each approach offers its own advantages and helps in centralizing and managing dependencies efficiently.

== Using Convention plugins

3. **Convention Plugins**:
- **Description**: Convention plugins define conventions and configurations that can be applied consistently across projects.
- **Implementation**: Create a custom Gradle plugin that configures common dependencies, repositories, and other settings according to your organization's conventions. Apply this plugin in your projects to enforce these conventions.
- **Benefits**: Promotes consistency, reduces boilerplate code, and makes it easier to onboard new team members.

== Using a Version catalog

2. **Version Catalog**:
- **Description**: A version catalog is a centralized list of dependency versions that can be referenced in multiple projects.
- **Implementation**: Use a custom plugin or script to define a version catalog containing versions of commonly used dependencies. Reference this catalog in your projects to ensure consistent version management.
- **Benefits**: Simplifies dependency management by centralizing version definitions and promoting consistency across projects.

== Using Dependency locking

1. **Lockfile**:
- **Description**: A lockfile is a file that stores the exact versions of dependencies used in a project, preventing unexpected changes in dependencies when a project is built on different machines or at different times.
- **Implementation**: Gradle does not natively support lockfiles like some other tools (e.g., npm with `package-lock.json`). However, you can achieve a similar result by generating a `dependencies.lock` file using a custom task or plugin that resolves and records the exact versions of dependencies.
- **Benefits**: Ensures reproducible builds and avoids dependency version conflicts.
