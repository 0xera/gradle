### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the use case or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

### Configuration cache improvements

The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build time by caching the result of the configuration phase and reusing it for subsequent builds.
This feature can significantly improve build performance.

#### More precise information about file changes that cause a configuration cache miss

Before this release, when a configuration cache entry could not be reused due to a change to some file, the console output would show this message:

> Calculating task graph as configuration cache cannot be reused because file '.../some-file.txt' **has changed**.

even if the file was not actually changed, but removed, or replaced with a directory.

Starting with this release, you get additional information detailing the kind of change. For example:

> Calculating task graph as configuration cache cannot be reused because file '.../some-file.txt' **has been removed**.

or

> Calculating task graph as configuration cache cannot be reused because file '.../some-file.txt' **has been replaced by a directory**.
