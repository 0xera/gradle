Gradle Script Kotlin 1.0 M1a Release Notes
==========================================

This release is a patch to the preceding [`1.0 M1` release][1]. It
upgrades Gradle Script Kotlin's dependency on
`org.jetbrains:kotlin-compiler-embeddable` from `1.1.0-dev-372` to
`1.1.0-dev-372a`. The latter is our own custom patch that removes a
problematic `META-INF/services` file from the jar that causes failures
at Gradle runtime.

This release should be used in favor of `1.0 M1` in all cases, and all
the features and limitations detailed in the original [`1.0 M1` release
notes][1] still apply.

The failure in question is caused by the fact that the `CharsetProvider`
implementation specified in the offending `META-INF/services` file is a
fully-qualified classname that (we assume) does exist in the usual
`kotlin-compiler` jar, but does not actually exist in the
`kotlin-compiler-embeddable` jar. The reason it does not exist is that
the contents of the `-embeddable` jar are shaded (repackaged) so as to
avoid classloading conflicts, but that shading is not reflected in
`META-INF/services` files correctly.
