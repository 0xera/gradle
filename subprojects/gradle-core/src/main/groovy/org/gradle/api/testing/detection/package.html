    Classes for detecting tests.

    <h1>TestDetectionOrchestrator</h1>

    <p>Handles all aspects regarding test detection for the TestOrchestrator.</p>

    <h1>TestClassProcessor</h1>

    <p>Because we have 2 ways of running tests (through Ant and natively) we have 2 separate ways of how test
    classes need to be treated. </p>
    <p>When running tests with Ant all tests are collected in a set by the SetBuildingTestClassProcessor.</p>
    <p>When running tests natively all tests are queued on a queue.</p>

    <h1>ClassFileExtractionManager</h1>

    <p>Used to extract class files from library jars so they can be scanned. All the extracted class files are deleted on
    exit of the Gradle process.</p>
