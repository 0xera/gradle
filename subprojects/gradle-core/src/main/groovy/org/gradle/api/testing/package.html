    Classes for running tests natively.

    <h1>TestFrameworkRegister</h1>

    <p>The TestFrameworkRegister keeps track of all supported TestFrameworks.</p>

    <h1>TestOrchestrator</h1>

    <p>A TestOrchestrator controls native test execution for a single NativeTest task instance.</p>

    <p>Instances of TestOrchestratorAction are used to perform all the actions that need to be executed by the
    test orchestrator. After each action completes the test orchestrator checks if the test execution needs to continue.</p>
