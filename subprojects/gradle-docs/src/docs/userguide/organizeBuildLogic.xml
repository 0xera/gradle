    <title>Organizing Build Logic</title>
    <para>Gradle offers a variety of ways to organize your build logic. First of all you can put your build logic
        directly in the action closure of a task. If a couple of tasks share the same logic you can extract this logic
        into a method. If multiple projects of a multi-project build share some logic you can define this method in the
        parent project. If the build logic gets too complex for being properly modeled by methods you want have an OO
        Model.
        <footnote>
            <para>Which might range from a single class to something very complex.
            </para>
        </footnote>
        Gradle makes this very easy. Just drop your classes in a certain directory and Gradle automatically compiles them
        and puts them in the classpath of your build script.
    </para>

    <section>
        <title>Inherited properties and methods</title>
        <para>Any method or property defined in a project build script is also visible to all the sub-projects. You
            can use this to define common configurations, and to extract build logic into methods which can be reused
            by the sub-projects.
        </para>
        <sample id="inheritedBuildLogic" dir="userguide/organizeBuildLogic/inherited" title="Using inherited properties and methods">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <sourcefile file="child/build.gradle"/>
            <output args="-q show"/>
        </sample>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Injected properties and methods</title>
        <para>You can use the configuration injection technique discussed in <xref linkend="sec:cross_project_configuration"/>
            and <xref linkend="sec:subproject_configuration"/> to inject properties and methods into various projects.
            This is generally a better option than inheritance, for a number of reasons: The injection is
            explicit in the build script. You can inject different logic into different projects. And you can inject
            any kind of configuration: repositories, plug-ins, tasks, and so on.
            The following sample shows how this works.
        </para>
        <sample id="injectedBuildLogic" dir="userguide/organizeBuildLogic/injected" title="Using injected properties and methods">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <sourcefile file="child1/build.gradle"/>
            <output args="-q show"/>
        </sample>
    </section>
    
    <section id='sec:build_sources'>
        <title>Build sources</title>
        <para>If you run Gradle, it checks for the existence of a directory called <filename>buildSrc</filename>. Just put
            your build source code in this directory and stick to the layout convention for a Java/Groovy project (see
            <xref linkend='javalayout'/>). Gradle then automatically compiles and tests this code and puts it in
            the classpath of your build script. You don't need to provide any further instruction. This can be a good
            place to add your custom tasks and plugins.
        </para>
        <para>For multi-project builds there can be only one <filename>buildSrc</filename> directory, which has to be
            in the root project.
        </para>
        <para>This is probably good enough for most of the cases. If you need more flexibility, you can provide a
            <filename>build.gradle</filename> and a <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file in the
            <filename>buildSrc</filename> directory. If you like, you can even have a multi-project build in there.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id='sec:external_dependencies'>
        <title>External dependencies for the build script</title>
        <para>If your build script needs to use external libraries, you can add them to the script's classpath in the
            build script itself. You do this using the <literal>buildscript()</literal> method, passing in a closure which
            declares the build script classpath.
        </para>
        <sample id="declareExternalBuildDependency" dir="userguide/organizeBuildLogic/externalDependency" title="Declaring external dependencies for the build script">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="declare-classpath"/>
        </sample>
        <para>The closure passed to the <literal>buildscript()</literal> method configures a
            <apilink class="org.gradle.api.initialization.dsl.ScriptHandler"/> instance. You declare the build script
            classpath by adding dependencies to the <literal>classpath</literal> configuration. This is the same way
            you declare, for example, the Java compilation classpath. You can use any of the dependency types described
            in <xref linkend='sec:how_to_declare_your_dependencies'/>, except project dependencies.</para>
        <para>Having declared the build script classpath, you can use the classes in your build script as you would
            any other classes on the classpath. The following example adds to the previous example, and uses classes
            from the build script classpath.</para>
        <sample id="externalBuildDependency" dir="userguide/organizeBuildLogic/externalDependency" title="A build script with external dependencies">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <output args="-q encode"/>
        </sample>
        <para>
            For multi-project builds, the dependencies declared in the a project's build script, are available to the
            build scripts of all sub-projects.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id='sec:ant_optional_dependencies'>
        <title>Ant optional dependencies</title>
        <para>For reasons we don't fully understand yet, external dependencies are not picked up by Ant's optional
            tasks. But you can easily do it in another way.
            <footnote>
                <para>In fact, we think this is anyway the nicer solution. Only if your buildscript and Ant's optional
                    task need the <emphasis>same</emphasis> library you would have to define it two times. In such a
                    case it would be nice, if Ant's optional task would automatically pickup the classpath defined
                    in the <literal>gradesettings</literal>.
                </para>
            </footnote>
        </para>
        <sample id="buildLogic" dir="userguide/organizeBuildLogic" title="Ant optional dependencies">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
        </sample>
        <para>This is also nice example for the usage of client modules. The pom.xml in maven central for the
        ant-commons-net task does not provide the right information for this use case.</para>

        <title>Summary</title>
        <para>Gradle offers you a variety of ways of organizing your build logic. You can choose what is right for your
            domain and find the right balance between unnecessary indirections, and avoiding redundancy and a hard to
            maintain code base. It is our experience that even very complex custom build logic is rarely shared between
            different builds. Other build tools enforce a separation of this build logic into a separate project. Gradle
            spares you this unnecessary overhead and indirection.
