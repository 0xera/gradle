    <title>Custom Build Language</title>
    <para>This sample demonstrates how to add some custom elements to the build DSL.</para>
    <para>The build is composed of 2 types of projects. The first type of project represents a product. The second type
        represents a product module. Each product includes one or more product modules, and each product module may be
        included in multiple products. That is, there is a many-to-many relationship between these products and product
        modules.
    </para>

        <title>How the build is organised</title>
        <para>The build scripts of each project contain a very small number of declarative elements. The bulk of the
            work is done by 2 custom plugins found in <filename>buildSrc/src/main/groovy</filename>.
        </para>
