# Composite build to develop a Gradle plugin

This sample demonstrates a composite build used to develop a Gradle plugin in conjunction with a consuming build. This plugin can then easily be published to be shared with other Gradle builds.

This setup removes the need for a `buildSrc` project for developing a plugin.
