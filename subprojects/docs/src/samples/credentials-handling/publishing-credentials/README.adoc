This sample shows how credentials can be passed to a maven publish task using link:{userManualPath}/build_environment.html#sec:project_properties[project properties].
This approach allows to externalize the sensitive configuration from the project source code and inject it only when needed.

To demonstrate the concept, we will be using a stubbed maven HTTP repository that accepts the following hardcoded credentials:
====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="buildSrc/src/main/java/com/example/MavenRepositoryStub.java[tags=credentials]"]
====

This project has some sample Java code to be compiled and published as a Java library.
Gradle build file registers a publication to a maven repository:
====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=publication]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=publication]"]
====

Authentication credentials are configured and validated only if the publication task is going to be invoked in the current build:
====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=credentials]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=credentials]"]
====

Credential values are declared to be Gradle properties and can be passed to the publish task in multiple ways:

* via command-line properties:
=====
----
$ ./gradlew publish -PmavenUser=secret-user -PmavenPassword=secret-password
----
=====
* via environment variables:
=====
----
$ ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenUser=secret-user ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenPassword=secret-password ./gradlew publish
----
=====
* by setting the properties in `gradle.properties` file:
=====
----
mavenUser=secret-user
mavenPassword=secret-password
----
=====
and running
=====
----
$ ./gradlew publish
----
=====
This way the sensitive data can be kept outside of the project sources - `gradle.properties` can reside in the user's `~/.gradle` directory.
The values are also not echoed anywhere this way.
