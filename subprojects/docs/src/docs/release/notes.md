### More convenient testing of Gradle plugins

Gradle 2.6 introduced the “[Gradle TestKit](userguide/test_kit.html)” which made it easier to thoroughly test Gradle plugins.
The TestKit has improved and matured with subsequent Gradle releases.
Starting with Gradle 2.13, less manual build configuration is required in order to inject the implementation of your plugin into your tests.

When using the [Java Gradle Plugin Development Plugin](userguide/javaGradle_plugin.html),
the plugin being developed will now be implicitly made available to all builds under test,
removing the need for any manual configuration.

See the [TestKit chapter in the Gradle User Guide](userguide/test_kit.html#sub:test-kit-automatic-classpath-injection) for more about this new feature.

### Customizing the HTML reports of Checkstyle and FindBugs

The HTML reports generated by the Checkstyle and FindBugs plugins can now be customized with local XSLT stylesheets.
See the documentation for the [Checkstyle](userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html) and [FindBugs](userguide/findbugs_plugin.html)
plugins for more details. Note that sample stylesheets for both plugins are available at:

- Checkstyle: [https://github.com/checkstyle/contribution/tree/master/xsl](https://github.com/checkstyle/contribution/tree/master/xsl)
- Findbugs: [https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/tree/master/findbugs/src/xsl](https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/tree/master/findbugs/src/xsl)

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Deleting no longer follows symlinks.

The Delete task will no longer follow symlinks by default and project.delete() will not follow symlinks at all. Previous versions of Gradle would follow-symlinks during deletions. If you need the Delete
task to follow symlinks set `followSymlinks = true`. If you need `project.delete()` to follow symlinks, replace it with `ant.delete()`. This was done to prevent issues where Gradle would attempt to delete files
outside of Gradle's build directory (e.g. NPM installed in a user-writeable location.).
