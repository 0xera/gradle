The Gradle team has an important update to [2.14](https://docs.gradle.org/2.14/release-notes). This release fixes a critical defect to incremental builds that may prevent Gradle from executing tasks when inputs or outputs are out of date. This affects the correctness of builds using Gradle 2.14.

This release also contains two minor fixes to the Ear and CodeNarc plugins, see the fixed issues below for more information. 

It does not include any new features. We strongly recommend anyone upgrading from an older version to upgrade to Gradle 2.14.1 instead of Gradle 2.14.
