The Gradle team has an important update to [3.4](https://docs.gradle.org/3.4/release-notes). This release fixes critical defects to the Java incremental compilation that may prevent recompilation.

It does not include any new features. We recommend anyone upgrading from an older version to upgrade straight to Gradle 3.4.1 instead of Gradle 3.4.
