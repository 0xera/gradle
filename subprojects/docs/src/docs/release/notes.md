Gradle 2.3 brings some nice new capabilities to dependency management, as well as improvements to a couple of core plugins.

A much requested feature is the ability to access the Ivy and Maven metadata artifacts that Gradle uses to perform dependency resolution.
Using the Artifact Query API, you now have direct access to these raw metadata artifacts. This could be useful for generating an offline
repository, inspecting the files for custom metadata, and much more.

As always, this Gradle release benefits from a large number of community contributions. These include substantial improvements to the
ANTLR and Build Comparison plugins, as well as many of the issues that have been fixed in this release.

Under the covers, a lot of progress has been made on the new configuration and component models. While this progress may not
be visible to your builds, it is evidenced in some of the changes made to the native component plugins. Expect to see more about
this exciting progress in an upcoming release announcement.

## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Access Ivy and Maven metadata artifacts via the Artifact Query API (i)

Gradle 2.0 introduced an incubating [query API for resolving component artifacts](http://www.gradle.org/docs/2.0/release-notes#new-api-for-resolving-source-and-javadoc-artifacts).

In this release this API has been extended to allow for retrieving the metadata artifacts for Ivy and Maven modules. 
This means that a build can access the raw `ivy.xml` or `module.pom` file that Gradle used when resolving a dependency.

Given that the dependency is resolved from an Ivy repository, the Ivy descriptor artifact can be retrieved as follows:

    task resolveIvyDescriptorFiles {
        doLast {
            def componentIds = configurations.compile.incoming.resolutionResult.allDependencies.collect { it.selected.id }

            def result = dependencies.createArtifactResolutionQuery()
                .forComponents(componentIds)
                .withArtifacts(IvyModule, IvyDescriptorArtifact)
                .execute()

            for (component in result.resolvedComponents) {
                component.getArtifacts(IvyDescriptorArtifact).each { assert it.file.name == 'ivy.xml' }
            }
        }
    }

For a dependency that is resolved from a Maven repository, the Maven POM artifact can be retrieved as follows:

    task resolveMavenPomFiles {
        doLast {
            def componentIds = configurations.compile.incoming.resolutionResult.allDependencies.collect { it.selected.id }

            def result = dependencies.createArtifactResolutionQuery()
                .forComponents(componentIds)
                .withArtifacts(MavenModule, MavenPomArtifact)
                .execute()

            for(component in result.resolvedComponents) {
                component.getArtifacts(MavenPomArtifact).each { assert it.file.name == 'some-artifact-1.0.pom' }
            }
        }
    }

See the [ArtifactResolutionQuery API reference](dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.query.ArtifactResolutionQuery.html) for more details.

### Component metadata rule enhancements (i)

Using a component metadata rule, some details of the metadata for a component can be modified based on custom build logic.
This can be used to specify that components produced by a particular organisation have a custom 'status scheme', or that
all components for a particular module should be considered 'changing'.

The interface for defining component metadata rules has been enhanced. It is now possible to define rules that apply to a
particular module, as well as rules that apply to all components.

- Use <a href="dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.ComponentMetadataHandler.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.ComponentMetadataHandler:all(groovy.lang.Closure)">`components.all`</a> to define a rule that applies to all components.
- Use <a href="dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.ComponentMetadataHandler.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.ComponentMetadataHandler:withModule(java.lang.Object, groovy.lang.Closure)">`components.withModule('group:name')`</a> to define a rule that applies to any component that matches the supplied 'group' and 'name' attributes.

Note that `components.eachComponent` has been replaced with `components.all`, with the former being deprecated for removal in Gradle 2.4.

    dependencies {
        components {
            // This rule applies to all modules
            all { ComponentMetadataDetails details ->
                if (details.group == "my.org" && details.status == "integration") {
                    details.changing = true
                }
            }

            // This rule applies to only the "my.org:api" module
            withModule("my.org:api") { ComponentMetadetails details ->
                details.statusScheme = [ "testing", "candidate", "release" ]
            }
        }
    }
    
    
Furthermore, rules can now also be specified as `rule source` objects, allowing them to be defined more easily in Java code:

    dependencies {
        components {
            // This rule uses a rule source object that applies only to the "my.org:api" module
            withModule("my.org:api", new CustomStatusRule()) // See class definition below
        }
    }

    class CustomStatusRule {
        @Mutate
        void setComponentStatus(ComponentMetadataDetails details) {
            if (details.status == "integration") {
                details.status = "testing"
            }
        }
    }

See the [userguide section](userguide/dependency_management.html#component_metadata_rules) on component metadata rules for further information.

### Improvements to the ANTLR plugin

Gradle has built-in support for parser generation using [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org) using the [ANTLR Plugin](userguide/antlr_plugin.html). 
Gradle 2.3 contains improvements to this support.

Adding to the existing support for ANTLR version `2.x`, Gradle now supports ANTLR versions `3.x` and `4.x` of .
To use ANTLR version 3 or 4 in a build, simply add the correct dependency to the `antlr` configuration:

    apply plugin: "java"
    apply plugin: "antlr"

    repositories() {
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        antlr 'org.antlr:antlr4:4.3'
    }


Additionally, the [`AntlrTask`](dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.antlr.AntlrTask.html) now executes ANTLR in a separate process. 
This allows more fine grained control over memory settings for the ANTLR process.

See the [user guide chapter on the Antlr Plugin](userguide/antlr_plugin.html) for further details.

These improvements were contributed by [Rob Upcraft](https://github.com/upcrob).

### Build Comparison plugin now compares nested archives

The [Gradle Build Comparison plugin](userguide/comparing_builds.html) provides support for comparing the outcomes (e.g. the produced binary archives) of two builds.
This support is greatly improved in Gradle 2.3, with the ability to compare entries of nested archives.
A common type of nested archive that benefits from this change is a `WAR` file containing `JAR` files.

Previously, when comparing an archive for changes, the entries of that archive were treated as binary blobs. 
So Gradle would detect if a particular entry had changed, but would not inspect more deeply to see _how_ it had changed. 
As of Gradle 2.3, entries of archive entries are inspected recursively where possible. 
This means that archive entries that are themselves archives are compared entry by entry.

This feature was contributed by [Bj√∂rn Kautler](https://github.com/Vampire).

### Tooling API improvements

The Gradle tooling API provides a stable API that tools such as IDEs can use to embed Gradle. 

In Gradle 2.3, the tooling API now supports generating colored build output, identical to that generated by Gradle on the command-line. 
This feature was contributed by [Lari Hotari](https://github.com/lhotari).

When using the `GradleConnector` to create a tooling API connection, the method [`GradleConnector.useBuildDistribution()`](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/GradleConnector.html#useBuildDistribution--) can now be used 
to explicitly declare that the distribution defined by the target Gradle build should be used.

### New `PluginManager` interface for applying and managing plugins by id

In the past, the [`PluginContainer`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/plugins/PluginContainer.html) API has been used for applying and querying plugins. This interface has a number of problems,
including only supporting instances of `Plugin`, providing mutation methods that are not properly supported, and requiring that plugin instances
be instantiated immediately on applying.

Gradle 2.3 introduces a new [`PluginManager`](dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.PluginManager.html) API which addresses these issues, fully supporting `RuleSource` plugins and dealing better with
plugin identification. While `PluginContainer` is not deprecated, build authors should prefer to use `PluginManager` methods where possible.

Useful methods include:

- [`PluginManager.hasPlugin(String id)`](dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.PluginManager.html#hasPlugin-java.lang.String-)
- [`PluginManager.findPlugin(String id)`](dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.PluginManager.html#findPlugin-java.lang.String-)
- [`PluginManager.withPlugin(String id, Action action)`](dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.PluginManager.html#withPlugin-java.lang.String-org.gradle.api.Action-)

These methods should be used when reacting to the presence of another plugin or for ad-hoc reporting.

### Application plugin is integrated with the Distribution plugin

The [Application Plugin](userguide/application_plugin.html) now leverages the [Distribution Plugin](userguide/distribution_plugin.html) for doing packaging. 
By configuring the 'main' distribution, a packaged application is treated as any other distribution.

For example, you can use `gradle installDist` to create an image of your application,
`gradle distZip` to create a ZIP distribution of your application, and `gradle assemble` to build all application distributions. 

This feature was contributed by [S√©bastien Cogneau](https://github.com/scogneau).

### Groovy version upgraded to 2.3.9

Gradle 2.3 includes Groovy 2.3.9 (upgraded from Groovy 2.3.6 in Gradle 2.2.1).

This is a non breaking change.
All build scripts and plugins that work with Gradle 2.2.1 should continue to work without change or recompilation.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the ‚Äú[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)‚Äù for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://forums.gradle.org).

### Renamed method on ComponentMetadataHandler

The `eachComponent` method on the incubating `ComponentMetadataHandler` interface has been deprecated and replaced with `all`.

As this is an incubating feature, the deprecated method will be removed in Gradle 2.4.

### `--no-color` command-line option

The `--no-color` option has been replaced by the more general `--console` option. You can use `gradle --console plain ...` instead of `gradle --no-color ...`.

The `--no-color` option will be removed in Gradle 3.0.

### Deprecated 'installApp' task in Application Plugin

The `installApp` task of the application plugin is deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 3.0. You can use the `installDist` task instead.

## Potential breaking changes

### AntlrTask has incremental task action

The [`AntlrTask`](dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.AntlrTask.html) now processes input files incrementally.
To do so, the [`execute`](dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.AntlrTask.html#execute) has been changed to accept an
`IncrementalTaskInputs` parameter.

This will break any code that calls the `execute` method of this task directly.

### Major changes to incubating 'native-component' and 'jvm-component' plugins

As we develop a new configuration and component model for Gradle, we are also developing an underlying infrastructure to allow
the easy implementation of plugins supporting new platforms (native/jvm/javascript) and languages (C/C++/Java/Scala/CoffeeScript).

This version of Gradle takes a big step in that direction, by migrating the existing component-based plugins to sit on top of this
new infrastructure. This includes the incubating 'jvm-component' and 'java-lang' plugins, as well as all of the plugins providing
support for building native applications.

Due to this, the DSL for defining native executables and libraries has fundamentally changed. The `executables` and `libraries` containers
have been removed, and components are now added by type to the `components` container owned by the model registry. Another major change is
that source sets for a component are now declared directly within the component definition, instead of being configured on the `sources` block.

For comparison, the following native components defined in Gradle 2.2:

    libraries {
        hello {}
    }

    executables {
        main {}
    }

    sources {
        main {
            cpp {
                lib library: "hello"
                source {
                    srcDir "src/source"
                    include "**/*.cpp"
                }
                exportedHeaders {
                    srcDir "src/include"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
are defined as follows in Gradle 2.3:

    model {
        components {
            hello(NativeLibrarySpec)

            main(NativeExecutableSpec) {
                sources {
                   cpp {
                        lib library: "hello"
                        source {
                            srcDir "src/source"
                            include "**/*.cpp"
                        }
                        exportedHeaders {
                            srcDir "src/include"
                        }
                   }
                }
            }
        }
    }

The new syntax is more flexible to be used across different component domains, and will continue to be enhanced in the future.
Please take a look at the sample applications found in `samples/native-binaries` and `samples/jvmComponents` to get a better idea of how 
you may migrate your Gradle build to the new syntax.

Note that this functionality is a work-in-progress, and in some cases it may be preferable to remain on an earlier version of Gradle until
it has stabilised.

### Mapping of Maven version range selectors

The maven version declaration `LATEST` is mapped to `latest.integration` and `RELEASE` is mapped to `latest.release` when resolving a dependency from
a maven repository. The reverse mapping is applied when generating a pom file in Gradle (e.g. for publishing via `maven-publish` or `maven` plugin).

### Ivy dependency exclude rules

Previous versions of Gradle improperly handled the `name` attribute for [dependency exclude rules](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/ivyfile/artifact-exclude.html).
Instead of excluding the matching artifact(s), the whole module was excluded. This behavior has been fixed with this version of Gradle. Keep in mind that this change
may cause a slightly different dependency resolution behavior if you heavily rely on Ivy excludes.

In this context, we also fixed the incorrect handling of the `artifact` attribute for [module exclude rules](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/ivyfile/exclude.html). For
more information see [GRADLE-3147](https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-3147).

### Manually declared facets in eclipse-wtp plugin

In previous Gradle versions, declaring a custom facet for `eclipse.wtp` caused the default facets to be removed.

    eclipse {
        wtp {
            facet {
                facet name: 'someNeededFacet', version: '1.3'
            }
        }
    }

This behaviour has been fixed in this version of Gradle: declaring a facet in this way will add to the set of default facets.

This fix was contributed by [Andreas Schmid](https://github.com/aaschmid).

### Tooling API `GradleProject` model includes implicit tasks

The `GradleProject` model now includes the implicit tasks of a project, such as `help`, `tasks`, `dependencies`, and `wrapper`.

This change could impact code that relied on the fact that these tasks formerly were absent from [`GradleProject.getTasks()`](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/model/GradleProject.html#getTasks--).
