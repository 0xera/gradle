## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Component metadata rule enhancements

The interface for defining component metadata rules has been enhanced so that it now supports defining rules on a per module basis
as well as for all modules.  Furthermore, rules can now also be specified as `rule source` objects.

    dependencies {
        components {
            // This rule applies to all modules
            all { ComponentMetadataDetails details ->
                if (details.group == "my.org" && details.status == "integration") {
                    details.changing = true
                }
            }

            // This rule applies to only the "my.org:api" module
            withModule("my.org:api") { ComponentMetadetails details ->
                details.statusScheme = [ "testing", "candidate", "release" ]
            }

            // This rule uses a rule source object to define another rule for "my.org:api"
            withModule("my.org:api", new CustomStatusRule()) // See class definition below
        }
    }

    class CustomStatusRule {
        @Mutate
        void setComponentStatus(ComponentMetadataDetails details) {
            if (details.status == "integration") {
                details.status = "testing"
            }
        }
    }

See the [userguide section](userguide/dependency_management.html#component_metadata_rules) on component metadata rules for further information.

### New PluginAware methods for detecting the presence of plugins

The `PluginAware` interface (implemented by `Project`, `Gradle` and `Settings`) has the following new methods for detecting the presence of plugins, based on ID:

* findPlugin()
* hasPlugin()
* withPlugin()

These methods should be used when reacting to the presence of another plugin or for ad-hoc reporting.

TODO - more detail.

### ANTLR plugin supports ANTLR version 3.X and 4.X

Additionally to the existing 2.X support, the [ANTLR Plugin](userguide/antlrPlugin.html) now supports ANTLR version 3 and 4. 
To use ANTLR version 3 or 4 in a build, an according antlr dependency must be declared explicitly:

    apply plugin: "java"
    apply plugin: "antlr"
    
    repositories() {
        jcenter()
    }
    
    dependencies {
        antlr 'org.antlr:antlr4:4.3'
    }
  
This feature was contributed by [Rob Upcraft](https://github.com/upcrob).

### AntlrTask running in separate process

The [`AntlrTask`](dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.AntlrTask.html) is now 
executed in a separate process. This allows more fine grained control over memory settings just for the ANTLR process.
See [Antlr Plugin](userguide/antlrPlugin.html) for further details. 

This feature was also contributed by [Rob Upcraft](https://github.com/upcrob).

### Build Comparison plugin now compares nested archives

The [Build Comparison plugin](userguide/comparing_builds.html) has been improved in this release to compare entries of nested archives.
Previously, when comparing an archive all archive entries were treated as binary blobs.
Now, entries of archive entries are inspected recursively where possible.
That is, archive entries that are themselves archives are compared entry by entry.
A common type of nested archive is a WAR file containing JAR files.

This feature was contributed by [Björn Kautler](https://github.com/Vampire).

### Tooling API improvements

The Gradle tooling API provides a stable API that tools such as IDEs can use to embed Gradle. In Gradle 2.3, the tooling API now supports generating
colored build output, identical to that generated by Gradle on the command-line. This feature was contributed by Lari Hotari.

Tooling API JAR is now OSGi compatible. Its manifest is generated using [Bnd](http://www.aqute.biz/Bnd/Bnd) tool.

### Access the Ivy and Maven metadata artifacts via the Artifact Query API for component ID(s)

Gradle 2.0 introduced an incubating [API for resolving component artifacts](http://www.gradle.org/docs/2.0/release-notes#new-api-for-resolving-source-and-javadoc-artifacts).
With this release the Artifact Query API also allows for retrieving the metadata artifacts for Ivy and Maven modules. The following examples assume the declaration of a single dependency
for the `compile` configuration:

    dependencies {
        compile 'some.group:some-artifact:1.0'
    }

Given that the dependency is resolved from an Ivy repository, the Ivy descriptor artifact can be retrieved as follows:

    task resolveIvyDescriptorFiles {
        doLast {
            def componentIds = configurations.compile.incoming.resolutionResult.allDependencies.collect { it.selected.id }

            def result = dependencies.createArtifactResolutionQuery()
                .forComponents(componentIds)
                .withArtifacts(IvyModule, IvyDescriptorArtifact)
                .execute()

            for(component in result.resolvedComponents) {
                component.getArtifacts(IvyDescriptorArtifact).each { assert it.file.name == 'ivy.xml' }
            }
        }
    }

Given that the dependency is resolved from a Maven repository, the Maven POM artifact can be retrieved as follows:

    task resolveMavenPomFiles {
        doLast {
            def componentIds = configurations.compile.incoming.resolutionResult.allDependencies.collect { it.selected.id }

            def result = dependencies.createArtifactResolutionQuery()
                .forComponents(componentIds)
                .withArtifacts(MavenModule, MavenPomArtifact)
                .execute()

            for(component in result.resolvedComponents) {
                component.getArtifacts(MavenPomArtifact).each { assert it.file.name == 'some-artifact-1.0.pom' }
            }
        }
    }

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://forums.gradle.org).

### Renamed method on ComponentMetadataHandler

The `eachComponent` method on the incubating `ComponentMetadataHandler` interface has been deprecated and replaced with `all`.
As this is an incubating feature, the deprecated method will be removed in Gradle 2.3.

### `--no-color` command-line option

The `--no-color` option has been replaced by the more general `--console` option. You can use `gradle --console plain ...` instead of `gradle --no-color ...`.

The `--no-color` option will be removed in Gradle 3.0.

## Potential breaking changes

### Major changes to incubating 'native-component' and 'jvm-component' plugins

As we develop a new configuration and component model for Gradle, we are also developing an underlying infrastructure to allow
the easy implementation of plugins supporting new platforms (native/jvm/javascript) and languages (C/C++/Java/Scala/CoffeeScript).

This version of Gradle takes a big step in that direction, by migrating the existing component-based plugins to sit on top of this
new infrastructure. This includes the incubating 'jvm-component' and 'java-lang' plugins, as well as all of the plugins providing
support for building native applications.

Due to this, the DSL for defining native executables and libraries has fundamentally changed. The `executables` and `libraries` containers
have been removed, and components are now added by type to the `components` container owned by the model registry. Another major change is
that source sets for a component are now declared directly within the component definition, instead of being configured on the `sources` block.

Please take a look at the sample applications found in `samples/native-binaries` to get a better idea of how you may migrate your Gradle build
file to the new syntax.

Note that this functionality is a work-in-progress, and in some cases it may be preferable to remain on an earlier version of Gradle until
it has stabilised.

### Mapping of Maven version range selectors

The maven version declaration `LATEST` is mapped to `latest.integration` and `RELEASE` is mapped to `latest.release` when resolving a dependency from
a maven repository and vice versa when generating a pom file in Gradle (e.g. for publishing via `maven-publish` or `maven plugin`).

### Ivy dependency exclude rules

Previous versions of Gradle improperly handled the `name` attribute for [dependency exclude rules](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/ivyfile/artifact-exclude.html).
Instead of excluding the matching artifact(s), the whole module was excluded. This behavior has been fixed with this version of Gradle. Keep in mind that this change
may cause a slightly different dependency resolution behavior if you heavily rely on Ivy excludes.

In this context, we also fixed the incorrect handling of the `artifact` attribute for [module exclude rules](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/ivyfile/exclude.html). For
more information see [GRADLE-3147](https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-3147).

### Manually declared facets in eclipse-wtp plugin

In previous Gradle versions custom declared facets were improperly handled.
Declaring a custom facet as follows:

    eclipse {
        wtp {
            facet {
                facet name: 'someNeededFacet', version: '1.3'
            }
        }
    }

removed all the default facets instead of adding it to the default applied facets. This behaviour has been fixed with this version of Gradle.

This fix was contributed by [Andreas Schmid](https://github.com/aaschmid).
