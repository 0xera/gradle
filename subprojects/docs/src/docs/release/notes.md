## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in Gradle 1.3.

### Brand new 'dependency insight' report.

Gradle 1.2 introduced improvements to the regular "gradle dependencies" report.
Gradle 1.3 includes a brand new report which neatly complement the existing report.
The new report offers an insight into a particular, user-selected dependency (or dependencies).
Specifically, the report attempts to answer the questions that so many times the Gradle user has:

* Why this dependency is in the dependency graph? What pulls this dependency into the graph?
* What are all the requested versions of this dependency?
    Sometimes, various different versions of a given dependency participate in the dependency resolution.
    Gradle's conflict resolution selects one version to the resolved dependency graph,
    but what exactly are the candidate versions and where do they come from?
* Why the dependency has this particular version selected?
    Is it because of the conflict resolution or perhaps this version was forced?

The new report is invaluable when investigating what happens during the dependency resolution.
It is available out of the box - just check out the output of `gradle tasks`, look at the `Help` plugins section.
The new report is generated by the [DependencyInsightReportTask task](dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.diagnostics.DependencyInsightReportTask.html).
Advanced users can create instances of this task in the build script should they need to.

#### Example report

Given the following build script:

    apply plugin: 'java'

    repositories {
        maven { url "http://repo.gradle.org/gradle/repo" }
    }

    dependencies {
		compile 'org.gradle:gradle-tooling-api:1.2'
        compile 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.6.5'
    }

Let's find out about the 'org.gradle:gradle-messaging' dependency.
Compared to the `gradle dependencies` report, the dependency insight report shows an 'inverted' tree.
This means that the root of the tree is the dependency that matches the input criteria specified by the user.
Then, the tree recurses into the dependents. Please note how the dependency criteria is specified via the command line:

<pre><tt>&gt; gradle -u dependencyInsight --dependency org.gradle:gradle-messaging
:dependencyInsight
org.gradle:gradle-messaging:1.2
+--- org.gradle:gradle-tooling-api:1.2
|    \--- compile
\--- org.gradle:gradle-core:1.2
     \--- org.gradle:gradle-tooling-api:1.2 (*)

(*) - dependencies omitted (listed previously)</tt>
</pre>

How about an insight into 'sfl4j' dependency?
Note that Gradle informs why given version was used (conflict resolution).
This time, the 'runtime' configuration is selected - see how it is configured via the command line.
The default configuration the report uses is 'compile' (provided that the java-related plugin is applied).

<pre><tt>&gt; gradle dependencyInsight --dependency slf4j --configuration runtime
:dependencyInsight
org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.6.6 (conflict resolution)
+--- org.gradle:gradle-tooling-api:1.2
|    \--- runtime
+--- org.gradle:gradle-messaging:1.2
|    +--- org.gradle:gradle-tooling-api:1.2 (*)
|    \--- org.gradle:gradle-core:1.2
|         \--- org.gradle:gradle-tooling-api:1.2 (*)
+--- org.gradle:gradle-base-services:1.2
|    +--- org.gradle:gradle-tooling-api:1.2 (*)
|    +--- org.gradle:gradle-messaging:1.2 (*)
|    \--- org.gradle:gradle-core:1.2 (*)
\--- org.gradle:gradle-core:1.2 (*)

org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.6.5 -> 1.6.6
\--- runtime

(*) - dependencies omitted (listed previously)</tt>
</pre>

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to our backwards compatibility policy.

## Fixed Issues

The list of issues fixed between 1.2 and 1.3 can be found [here](http://issues.gradle.org/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-printable/temp/SearchRequest.html?jqlQuery=fixVersion+in+%28%221.3-rc-1%22%29+ORDER+BY+priority&tempMax=1000).

## Incubating features

We will typically introduce new features as _incubating_ at first, giving you a chance to test them out.
Typically the implementation quality of the new features is already good but the API might still change with the next release based on the feedback we receive.
For some very challenging engineering problems like the Gradle Daemon or parallel builds, it is impossible to get the implementation quality right from the beginning.
So we need you here also as beta testers.
We will iterate on the new feature based on your feedback, eventually releasing it as stable and production-ready.
Those of you who use new features before that point gain the competitive advantage of early access to new functionality in exchange for helping refine it over time.

### Improved TestNG html report

(in progress)

### Resolution result API

* (in progress)
* The entry point to the ResolutionResult API has changed, you can get access to the instance of the ResolutionResult from the ResolvableDependencies.

## Upgrading from Gradle 1.2

Please let us know if you encounter any issues during the upgrade to Gradle 1.3, that are not listed below.

### Deprecations

#### Ant-task based Java compiler integration

Gradle currently supports two different Java compiler integrations: A native Gradle integration that uses the compiler APIs directly, and an Ant-task
based implementation that uses the `<javac>` Ant task. The native Gradle integration has been the default since Gradle 1.0-milestone-9.

The Ant-task based integration has now been deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 2.0. As a result, the following properties of `CompileOptions` are also
deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 2.0:

* `useAnt`
* `optimize`
* `includeJavaRuntime`

#### Ant-task based Groovy compiler integration

Gradle currently supports two different Groovy compiler integrations: A native Gradle integration that uses the compiler APIs directly, and an Ant-task
based implementation that uses the `<groovyc>` Ant task. The native Gradle integration has been the default since Gradle 1.0.

The Ant-task based integration has now been deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 2.0. As a result, the following properties of `GroovyCompileOptions` are also
deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 2.0:

* `useAnt`
* `stacktrace`
* `includeJavaRuntime`

### Potential breaking changes

#### Incubating C++ `Compile` task type removed

This was replaced by `CppCompile` in Gradle 1.2. You should use the replacement class instead.

#### Incubating `GppCompileSpec` properties removed

The deprecated `task` property was removed from `GppCompileSpec`.

#### Removed GraphvizReportRenderer (private API)

This type was an early contribution. It is unlikely anyone uses it because it does not work and it is an undocumented private type.
