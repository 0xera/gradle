## Faster Groovy compilation

Gradle 5.6 includes two new features that accelerate Groovy compilation.

### Groovy compilation avoidance

Gradle now supports experimental compilation avoidance for Groovy. 

This speeds up Groovy compilation by avoiding re-compiling dependent projects if there are no changes that would affect the output of their compilation.

See [Groovy compilation avoidance](userguide/groovy_plugin.html#sec:groovy_compilation_avoidance) for more details.

### Incremental Groovy compilation

When compilation is necessary, Gradle now has experimental support for incremental Groovy compilation.

If only a small set of Groovy source files have been changed, only the affected source files will be recompiled.
For example, if you only change one Groovy test class, Gradle doesn't need to recompile all Groovy test source files. Gradle will recompile only the changed classes and the classes that are affected by them.

See [Incremental Groovy compilation](userguide/groovy_plugin.html#sec:incremental_groovy_compilation) in the user manual for more details.

## Test fixtures for Java projects

Gradle 5.6 introduces a new [Java test fixtures plugin](userguide/java_testing.html#sec:java_test_fixtures) that can be applied in combination with the `java` or `java-library` plugin to create a conventional `testFixtures` source set.
Gradle will automatically perform the necessary wiring so that `test` compilation depends on test fixtures. More importantly, this plugin also allows other projects to depend on the test fixtures of the project.

For example:
```groovy
dependencies {
   // this will add the test fixtures of "my-lib" on the compile classpath of the tests of _this_ project
   testImplementation(testFixtures(project(":my-lib")))
}
```

<a name="improved-plugin-management" />

## Central management of plugin versions with settings script

Gradle 5.6 makes it easier to manage the versions of plugins used by your build. By configuring all plugin versions in a settings script within the new `pluginManagement.plugins {}` block, build scripts can apply plugins via the `plugins {}` block without specifying a version.

```groovy
pluginManagement {
    plugins {
        id 'org.my.plugin' version '1.1'
    }
}
```

One benefit of managing plugin versions in this way is that the `pluginManagement.plugins {}` block does not have the same constrained syntax as a build script `plugins {}` block. Plugin versions may be loaded from `gradle.properties`, or defined programmatically.

See [plugin version management](userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugin_version_management) for more details.

## Better performance for very large projects on Windows using the Java library plugin

On Windows, very large multi-projects can suffer from a significant performance decrease in Java compilation when switching from the `java` to the `java-library` plugin. This is caused by the large number of class files on the classpath.

You can now tell the `java-library` plugin to [prefer jars over class folders on the compile classpath](userguide/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_known_issues_windows_performance) by setting the `org.gradle.java.compile-classpath-packaging` system property to `true`.

## Improved handling of ZIP archives on classpaths

Compile classpath and runtime classpath analysis will now detect the most common zip extension instead of only supporting `.jar`.

Gradle will inspect nested zip archives as well instead of treating them as blobs. This improves the likelihood of [build cache hits](userguide/build_cache.html) for tasks that take such nested zips as an input, e.g. when testing applications packaged as a fat jar.

ZIP analysis also avoids unpacking entries that are irrelevant. e.g., Resource files on a compile classpath. 
This improves performance for projects with a large number of resource files.

## Support for PMD incremental analysis

The PMD plugin now supports using PMD's incremental analysis cache to improve performance when files have not changed in between builds.  To enable incremental analysis, add the following to your PMD configuration:

```groovy
pmd {
    incrementalAnalysis = true
}
``` 

This was contributed by [Juan Martín Sotuyo Dodero](https://github.com/jsotuyod).

## Executable Jar support with `project.javaexec` and `JavaExec`

`JavaExec` and `project.javaexec` will now run an executable jar when the `JavaExec.main` property has not been set and the classpath resolves to a single file.

Under these circumstances, Gradle will assume that the single jar in the classpath is an executable jar and will run it with `java -jar`.  For proper execution, the `Main-Class` attribute will need to be set in the executable jar.

Thanks to [Stephan Windmüller](https://github.com/stovocor) for contributing the basis of this feature.

## Fail the build on deprecation warnings

The `warning-mode` command line option now has a [new `fail` value](userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings) that will behave like `all` and in addition fail the build if any deprecation warning was reported during the execution.

## Changes to file name case on case-insensitive file systems are now handled correctly

On case-insensitive file systems (e.g. NTFS and APFS), a file/folder rename where only the case is changed is now handled properly by Gradle's file copying operations. 

For example, renaming an input of a `Copy` task called `file.txt` to `FILE.txt` will now cause `FILE.txt` to be created in the destination directory. 

The `Sync` task and `Project.copy()` and `sync()` operations now also handle case-renames as expected.

## Unavailable files are handled more gracefully

Generally, broken symlinks, named pipes and unreadable files/directories (hereinafter referred to as unavailable files) found in inputs and outputs of tasks are handled gracefully from as if they don't exist.

For example, copying into a directory with a leftover named pipe or broken symbolic link will no longer break the build.

## Rich console output on Linux aarch64 machines

Gradle can now detect that it is running in an interactive terminal on Linux aarch64 machines, and will generate rich console output (such as colored text, progress information) in this case. 

Thanks to [Amey](https://github.com/ameyp) for adding this support to [native-platform](https://github.com/adammurdoch/native-platform/).

## Debug support for forked Java processes

Gradle has now a new DSL element to configure debugging for Java processes.  
 
```groovy
project.javaexec {

  debugOptions {
     enabled = true
     port = 4455
     server = true
     suspend = true
   }
}
```

This configuration appends the following JVM argument to the process: `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=4455` 
 
The `debugOptions` configuration is available for `project.javaExec` and for tasks using the `JavaExec` type, including the `test` task.

## Improvements for plugin authors

### Worker API improvements

This release introduces a number of improvements to the Worker API.

First, the classpath is now cleaner when submitting work using classloader or process isolation.  Extra jars (such as external jars used by Gradle itself) should no longer appear on the worker classpath.  

Second, new classes have been introduced to make defining the unit of work implementation more straightforward and type safe.  This also makes it simpler to handle null values in work parameters.  Instead of a `Runnable`, the unit of work is defined by extending the `WorkAction` and `WorkParameters` interfaces.  For example:

```groovy
// Define an interface that represents the parameters of your WorkAction.  Gradle will generate a parameters object from this interface.
interface ReverseParameters extends WorkParameters {
    Property<File> getFileToReverse()
    Property<File> getDestinationFile()
}

// Define an abstract class that represents your unit of work and uses the parameters defined above.
// No need to define the getParameters() method - this will be injected by Gradle.
abstract class ReverseFile implements WorkAction<ReverseParameters> {
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        File fileToReverse = parameters.fileToReverse.get()
        parameters.destinationFile.get().text = fileToReverse.text.reverse()
        if (Boolean.getBoolean("org.gradle.sample.showFileSize")) {
            println "Reversed ${fileToReverse.size()} bytes from ${fileToReverse.name}"
        }
    }
}
```

Last, new methods have been added to `WorkerExecutor` to make the API simpler and easier to use.  The `noIsolation()`, `classLoaderIsolation()` and `processIsolation()` methods all return a `WorkQueue` object that can be used to submit multiple items of work that have the same requirements.  For example:

```groovy
// Create a WorkQueue with requirements for all work that is submitted to it
WorkQueue workQueue = workerExecutor.processIsolation() { ProcessWorkerSpec spec ->
    // Configure the options for the forked process
    forkOptions { JavaForkOptions options ->
        options.maxHeapSize = "512m"
        options.systemProperty "org.gradle.sample.showFileSize", "true"
    }
}

// Create and submit a unit of work for each file
sourceFiles.each { file ->
    workQueue.submit(ReverseFile.class) { ReverseParameters parameters ->
        parameters.fileToReverse = file
        parameters.destinationFile = project.file("${outputDir}/${file.name}")
    }
}
```

See the [user manual](userguide/custom_tasks.html#using-the-worker-api) for more information on using the new API.  

The existing `WorkerExecutor.submit()` method can still be used, but will be deprecated in Gradle 6.0 and removed in Gradle 7.0.

### Task dependencies are honored for `@Input` properties of type `Provider`

Gradle can automatically calculate task dependencies based on the value of certain task input properties. 
For example, for a property that is annotated with `@InputFiles` and that has type `FileCollection` or `Provider<Set<RegularFile>>`, 
Gradle will inspect the value of the property and automatically add task dependencies for any task output files or directories in the collection. 

In this release, Gradle also performs this analysis on task properties that are annotated with `@Input` and that have type `Provider<T>` (which also includes types such as `Property<T>`).
This allow you to connect an output of a task to a non-file input parameter of another task.
For example, you might have a task that runs the `git` command to determine the name of the current branch, and another task that uses the branch name to produce an application bundle.
With this change you can connect the output of the first task as an input of the second task, and avoid running the `git` command at configuration time. 

See the [user manual](userguide/lazy_configuration.html#sec:working_with_task_dependencies_in_lazy_properties) for examples and more details.

### Convert a `FileCollection` to a `Provider`

A new method `FileCollection.getElements()` has been added to allow the contents of the file collection to be viewed as a `Provider`. This `Provider` tracks the elements of the file collection and tasks that
produce these files and can be connected to a `Property` instance.
 
### Finalize the value of a `ConfigurableFileCollection`

A new method `ConfigurableFileCollection.finalizeValue()` has been added. This method resolves deferred values, such as `Provider` instances or Groovy closures or Kotlin functions, that may be present in the collection 
to their final file locations and prevents further changes to the collection.

This method works similarly to other `finalizeValue()` methods, such as `Property.finalizeValue()`.

### Prevent changes to a `Property` or `ConfigurableFileCollection`

New methods `Property.disallowChanges()` and `ConfigurableFileCollection.disallowChanges()` have been added. These methods disallow further changes to the property or collection.

### `Provider` methods

New methods `Provider.orElse(T)` and `Provider.orElse(Provider<T>)` has been added. These allow you to perform an 'or' operation on a provider and some other value.

### Managed nested properties

A custom type, such as a task type, plugin or project extension can be implemented as an abstract class or, in the case of project extensions and other data types, an interface.
Under some conditions, Gradle can provide an implementation for abstract properties.

Now, if the custom type has an abstract getter annotated with `@Nested`, Gradle will provide an implementation for the getter method and also create a value for the property.
See the [user manual](userguide/custom_gradle_types.html#sec:managed_nested_properties) for more information.

## Improvements for tooling providers

### Debug tests via the Tooling API

The [Tooling API](userguide/embedding.html) is now capable of launching tests in debug mode with the [`TestLauncher.debugTestsOn(port)`](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/TestLauncher.html#debugTestsOn-int-) method.
