## Potential breaking changes

### Changed Java compiler integration for Java - Scala joint compilation

The `ScalaCompile` task type now uses the same Java compiler integration as used by `JavaCompile` and `GroovyCompile` task types, when performing Java - Scala joint
compilation. This change should be backwards compatible for all users.

### Incubating native language plugins no longer apply the base plugin

The native language plugins now apply the [`LifecycleBasePlugin`](dsl/org.gradle.language.base.plugins.LifecycleBasePlugin) instead of the `BasePlugin`. This means
that the default values defined by the `BasePlugin` are not available.

TBD - make this more explicit re. what is actually not longer available.
