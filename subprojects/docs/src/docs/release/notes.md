### Java software model

#### Compile avoidance

This version of Gradle further optimizes on avoiding recompiling consuming libraries after non-ABI breaking changes. Since 2.9, if a library declares an API, Gradle creates a "[stubbed API jar](userguide/java_software.html)". This enables avoiding recompiling any consuming library if the application binary interface (ABI) of the library doesn't change. This version of Gradle extends this functionality to libraries that don't declare their APIs, speeding up builds with incremental changes in most Java projects, small or large. In particular, a library `A` that depend on a library `B` will not need to be recompiled in the following cases:

* a private method is added to `B`
* a method body is changed in `B`
* order of methods is changed in `B`

This feature only works for local libraries, not external dependencies. More information about compile avoidance can be found in the [userguide](userguide/java_software.html).

#### Standalone JUnit test suite execution

It is now possible to declare a JUnit test suite as a software component. This incubating feature is however limited to standalone tests because the test suite doesn't yet have a component under test: it is possible to depend on a local library, but not *testing* a local library. This is the first step in providing first class support for test suites in the Java software model.

Declaring a test suite can be done like this:

    model {
        components {
            mySuite(JUnitTestSuiteSpec) {
                junitVersion '4.12'
            }
        }
    }

Then the suite can be executed running the `:mySuiteTest` task.

### Model rule improvements

#### Fine grained application of rules

TBD - A new kind of rule method is now available, which can be used to apply additional rules to some target.

This kind of method is annotated with `@Rules`. The first parameter defines a `RuleSource` type to apply, and the second parameter defines the target element to apply the rules to.

### Controlling test executing order in TestNG

This version of Gradle adds support for TestNG preserveOrder and groupByInstances options to control test order execution. More information about these features can be found in the [userguide](userguide/java_plugin.html#test_execution_order).

New options can be enabled in the useTestNG block:

    test {
        useTestNG {
            preserveOrder true
            groupByInstances true
        }
    }

This feature was contributed by [Richard Bergoin](https://github.com/kenji21).

### Ivy Publishing Improvements

The Ivy descriptor file generated by the ['ivy-publish'](userguide/publishing_ivy.html) plugin now includes dependency exclude information. Exclusions configured in your Gradle
build script on project or external module dependencies will be included in the published _ivy.xml_ file.

This feature was contributed by [Eike Kohnert](https://github.com/andrena-eike-kohnert).

### IDE integration improvements 

#### Tooling API exposes source language level on IdeaProject model

The `IdeaProject` model now exposes the Java source language level via the
<a href="javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/model/idea/IdeaProject.html#getJavaSourceSettings">`getJavaSourceSettings()`</a> method.
IDE providers use this method to automatically determine the source language level.

#### TODO

- Target Java version and JVM for Eclipse
- Target Java version and JVM for IDEA
- Generated `.classpath` project references correct JVM version

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 3.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Update to HttpClient 4.4.1

Gradle uses the Apache HttpComponents HttpClient library internally for features like dependency resolution and publication. This library has been updated
from version 4.2.2 to 4.4.1. As part of this upgrade, certain system properties are no longer taken into account when creating clients used for resolving and
publishing dependencies from HTTP repositories. Specifically, the 'http.keepAlive' and 'http.maxConnections' system properties are now ignored.

### Scala plugin no longer adds 'scalaConsole' tasks

Adding the 'scala' plugin to your build will no longer create 'scalaConsole' tasks which launch a Scala REPL from the Gradle build. This capability has been
removed due to lack of documentation and support for running with the Gradle Daemon. If you wish to continue to have such a task as part of your build, you
can explicitly configure a [`JavaExec`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.JavaExec.html) task to do so.

### Eclipse Plugin adds explicit java target runtime to Classpath

The `.classpath` file generated via `eclipseClasspath` task provided by the Eclipse Plugin now points to an explicit Java Runtime Version instead of
using the default JRE configured in the Eclipse IDE. The naming convention follows the Eclipse defaults.
To tweak the name of the Java runtime to use, the name can be configured via

    eclipse {
        jdt {
            javaRuntimeName = "JavaSE-1.8"
        }
    }
