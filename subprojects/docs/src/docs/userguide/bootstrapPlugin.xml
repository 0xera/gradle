    <title>Experimental Bootstrap Plugin</title>
    <para>The Gradle bootstrap plugin prepares the current project for Gradle.
        Typically it will create the relevant build.gradle, settings.gradle files.
        At the moment only conversion from maven3 is supported.</para>
    <para>
        The plugin is currently *experimental* which means it is already useful
        but not everything might work perfectly.
        The api, plugin and task names may change before the final release.
        Please let us know your feedback or report any issues.</para>
    <para>
        The plugin works by obtaining the effective pom of the current project
        by executing external 'mvn' command. Then it reads the dependencies
        and other information to generate build.gradle scripts.</para>
    <para>
        The plugin is inspired by the <ulink url="https://github.com/jbaruch/maven2gradle">maven2gradle tool</ulink>
        founded and maintained by recognized leaders of Gradle community;
        created by Baruch Sadogursky with contributions from Antony Stubbs and Matthew McCullough.

        <para>
            (*) - Note: Your project will be considered multi-module
            only if your reactor is also a parent of at least one of your modules.
            Why so? Reactor project is built last, when Parent project is built first.
            The reactor has to be built first, because effective-pom Mojo generates needed output
            only if it founds modules in first project it encounters.
            Making reactor also a parent achieves this.

        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>To convert a maven project follow the steps:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>Make sure your maven project builds and uses maven3.</listitem>
            <listitem>Make 'mvn' command can be executed and it runs maven3.</listitem>
            <listitem>Create 'build.gradle' file in the root folder.</listitem>
            <listitem>Specify "apply plugin: 'maven2Gradle'" and nothing else in the build.gradle file.</listitem>
            <listitem>Make sure you are using the Gradle version that contains the plugin.
                If necessary download the required Gradle version.
                Until Gradle 1.2 is released you should use the
                <link href="http://gradle.org/nightly">nightly build</link>.
                You only need this version for conversion of the maven project.
                When converting is complete feel free to use the desired Gradle version, for example 1.1.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>Run 'gradle tasks'. You should see 'maven2Gradle' task available.</listitem>
            <listitem>Run 'maven2Gradle'.</listitem>
            <listitem>Advanced users: you can configure following boolean properties on the 'maven2Gradle' task:
                'verbose' (shows more output, including the effective pom)
                and 'keepFile' (keeps the obtained effective pom file).</listitem>
