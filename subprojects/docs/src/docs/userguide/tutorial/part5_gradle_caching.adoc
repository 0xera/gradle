[[part5_gradle_caching]]
= Part 5: Enable the Gradle Cache

Learn the basics of Gradle's caching system.

****
**In this section you will:**

- Update Gradle Properties
- Turn on Local cache
- Understand caching
- Explore remote caching
****

[[part5_begin]]
== Before you begin

1. Complete <<part4_gradle_plugins#part4_begin,part 4>>.

== Step 1. Incremental Builds
In <<part2_gradle_tasks#part2_begin,part 2>>, you learned about tasks and in <<part4_gradle_plugins#part4_begin,part4>> you learned about plugins.

It's important to know that Gradle optimizes your build in a variety of ways.

One such optimization is called _incremental builds_.
An _incremental build_ is a build that avoids running tasks whose inputs and outputs did not change since the previous build, making the execution of such tasks unnecessary.

Another optimization is called caching. Let's turn on caching for your app.

== Step 2. Gradle Properties
In the top level folder of your app (`tutorial), create a `gradle.properties` file.

[source]
----
$ touch gradle.properties
----

Add `org.gradle.caching=true` so the contents of the file look like:
[source]
----
org.gradle.console=verbose
org.gradle.caching=true
----

TIP: It's also a good time to add verbose outputs to Gradle by setting `org.gradle.console=verbose`.

== Step 3. Use Local Cache
Run the clean task and then the build task to populate the cache.
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew :app:clean :app:build

> Task :app:clean
> Task :app:compileJava
> Task :app:processResources
> Task :app:classes
> Task :app:jar
> Task :app:startScripts
> Task :app:distTar
> Task :app:distZip
> Task :app:assemble
> Task :app:compileTestJava
> Task :app:processTestResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :app:testClasses
> Task :app:test
> Task :app:check
> Task :app:build

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s
9 actionable tasks: 9 executed
----

No surprise here, Gradle invoked all the tasks needed to build the app and it was done successfully.

Let's run the build again.
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew :app:build

> Task :app:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:processResources UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:classes UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:jar UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:startScripts UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:distTar UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:distZip UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:assemble UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:processTestResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :app:testClasses UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:test UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:check UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:build UP-TO-DATE
----

As we can see, Gradle used the _incremental build_ optimization.
Nothing has changed so Gradle has decided not to re-run some tasks.
Instead letting us know that inputs and outputs have not changed using the _outcome label_ `UP-TO-DATE`.

Now let's delete all the files by running the clean and build back to back:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew :app:clean :app:build

> Task :app:clean
> Task :app:compileJava FROM-CACHE
> Task :app:processResources
> Task :app:classes
> Task :app:jar
> Task :app:startScripts
> Task :app:distTar
> Task :app:distZip
> Task :app:assemble
> Task :app:compileTestJava FROM-CACHE
> Task :app:processTestResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :app:testClasses UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:test FROM-CACHE
> Task :app:check UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:build

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 551ms
9 actionable tasks: 6 executed, 3 from cache
----

Nothing has changed but files were deleted during the clean task so Gradle has to re-run tasks to re-build the App.

Gradle is efficient, especially with the local cache turn on.
Gradle will look at the cache directory on your machine to check for output files that may already exist. If they do, instead of running that task, it will copy its (output) results into your project `build` directory.

The _outcome label_ `FROM-CACHE` lets the user know that Gradle has fetched the task results from the local cache.

|===
|Outcome Label |Description

|UP-TO-DATE
|Task that has been already executed and hasn't changed (incremental build feature)

|SKIPPED
|Task has been skipped for some reason

|FROM-CACHE
|Task output has been copied to local directory from previous builds in the build cache (caching feature)

|NO-SOURCE
|Task is unexecuted because the input data required for its execution was not found
|===

== Step 4. Explore the Cache
The Gradle cache is located at:

- **On Windows**: %USERPROFILE%\.gradle\caches
- **On OS X / UNIX**: ~/.gradle/caches/

A _cache key_ is used by Gradle to identity, quickly, which tasks and which inputs were used to create the cached results (outputs).
If you use the `-i` argument you can see the _cache key_ used for each task input.

Run a clean followed by a build to see this:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew :app:clean :app:build -i

Initialized native services in: /Users/gradle-user/.gradle/native

...

> Task :app:compileJava FROM-CACHE
Build cache key for task ':app:compileJava' is 7e6149c74419964bc38b387f6639a655

You can see the cache entries by looking in the cache directory:

$ ls -ltr ~/.gradle/caches/build-cache-1/

`7e6149c74419964bc38b387f6639a655` is a TAR file.

When the file is decompressed, we can see it contains our `App` class:

image::tutorial/mac-tar-cache-exp.png[]

Gradle will periodically clean-up the local cache directory by removing entries that have not been used recently to conserve disk space.

== Step 5. Remote Caching
The remote cache (called a Build Cache Node) is a shared build cache available via HTTP.

The idea of a remote cache is to share commonly built task outputs across remote builds to improve build times.

When both remote and local caches are enabled, then the build output is first checked in the local cache.
If the output isn't present in the local cache, it'll be downloaded from the remote cache and also stored in the local cache.

A remote build cache is available for free from Gradle. Individuals and organizations can also deploy their own cache node which is distributed as a Docker image and a executable JAR.
