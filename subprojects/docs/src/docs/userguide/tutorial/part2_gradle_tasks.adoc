= Part 2: Running Gradle Tasks

Learn the basics of Gradle tasks by running one and looking at its output.

****
**In this section you will:**

- See available tasks
- Run a task and inspect the results
- Understand default and typed tasks
- Explore custom tasks
****

[[part2_begin]]
== Step 0. Before you Begin

1. Complete <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.

== Step 1. Viewing available Tasks
A _task_ is a basic unit of work that must be done by Gradle as part of the build.

In the `tutorial` directory, enter the command below to list all the available tasks:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks
----

The list includes tasks contributed by the `application` plugin and the plugin it applies:

[source]
----
Application tasks
-----------------
run - Runs this project as a JVM application

Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles the outputs of this project.
build - Assembles and tests this project.

...

Documentation tasks
-------------------
javadoc - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the main source code.

...

Other tasks
-----------
compileJava - Compiles main Java source.

...
----
Some of the available tasks assemble, run, compile code, and much more.
A task might be compiling some classes, storing class files into separate target folder, creating JAR files, generating Javadoc, or publishing artifacts to repositories.

You can also list the tasks only available in the `app` subproject by running `./gradlew :app:tasks`.

In <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>> of the tutorial, we ran the `build` task using the `./gradlew build` command.

== Step 2. Understanding Tasks
We've listed the tasks available when the project is initialized.
However, users can create custom tasks that perform some specific work.

Custom task code is typically available in the `build.gradle` file, or it can come as part of a custom plugin. We will learn more about plugins in <<part4_gradle_plugins#part4_begin,part 4>> of the tutorial.

Here is a example `Hello World` task:
[source]
----
task welcome {
    doLast {
        println('Welcome to Gradle!')
    }
}
----

This custom task, if added to `build.gradle.kts` file in the `app` subproject directory, would be executed using the command `./gradlew :app:welcome`.

Many times, a task requires another task to run first, especially if the task depends on the produced output of its dependency task.

- A task may declare its dependencies explicitly.
- A task may depend on other tasks implicitly.

Task execution order is automatically determined by Gradle, taking into account explicit dependencies and implicit dependencies.
If dependency is not available, Gradle enables users to request an execution order between tasks.

Here is an example of explicit task dependency:
[source]
----
task hello {
    println('Hello!')
}

task greet {
    println('How are you?')
}

greet.dependsOn(hello)
----

In this case, `hello` prints before `greet`. The output is `Hello! How are you?`.

== Step 3. Viewing Tasks in the IDE
Tasks are also available in IntelliJ.
The project should be open following <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>> of the tutorial.

On the right hand side of your window, open the `Gradle` pane:

image::tutorial/intellij-idea-tasks.png[]

== Step 4. Running Tasks in the IDE
You can run a task in IntelliJ by double-clicking it in the pane.

Double-click **tutorial > app > build > build**.

image::tutorial/intellij-idea-build.png[]

Make sure the build is successful:
[source]
----
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 966ms
7 actionable tasks: 7 executed
3:18:24 AM: Execution finished 'build'.
----

== Step 5. Running Tasks in the Terminal
The `jar` task can be used to create an executable JAR file of the App.

Run the following command in your terminal:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew jar
----

A `app.jar` file is now available in your `tutorial/app/build/libs/` folder.

Invoke the `run` task and check the output:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew run

> Task :app:run
Hello World!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 436ms
----

Take a moment and read the Java source code in `tutorial/app/src/main/java/com.gradle.tutorial/App.java`:
[source,java]
----
public class App {
    public String getGreeting() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(new App().getGreeting());
    }
}
----
== Step 6. Understanding Typed Tasks
Gradle tasks can be typed.
_Typed tasks_ are a subclass of the type link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Task.html[@Task].

This example shows a task of type `Copy`:
[source]
----
task copyTask(type: Copy) {
    from('source')
    into('target')
    include('*.war')
}
----

This task copies `*.war` files from the `source` directory to the `target` directory.

Popular tasks types include:

- **Copy** - `Copy` is useful to copy files around.
- **Delete** -  `Delete` is useful to delete files and directories.
- **Exec** - `Exec` is useful to execute arbitrary O/S commands.
- **Zip** - `Zip` is useful to bundle files.

Many more types are included in the DSL documentation.
