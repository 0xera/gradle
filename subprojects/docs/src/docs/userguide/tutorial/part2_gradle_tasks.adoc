= Part 2: Run and Explore Gradle Tasks

Learn the basics of Gradle tasks by running one and looking at its output.

****
**In this section you will:**

- See available tasks
- Run a task and inspect the results
- Understand default and typed tasks
- Explore custom tasks
****

[[part2_begin]]
== Before you begin

1. Complete <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.

== Step 1. List tasks
A _task_ is a piece of work that must be done by Gradle as part of the build.

In the `tutorial` directory, enter the command below to list all of the available tasks:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks --all
----

These are all of the default Gradle tasks available to run in your project:

[source]
----
Application tasks
-----------------
run - Runs this project as a JVM application

Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles the outputs of this project.
build - Assembles and tests this project.

...

Documentation tasks
-------------------
javadoc - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the main source code.

...

Other tasks
-----------
compileJava - Compiles main Java source.

...
----
Some of the default tasks available assemble, run, compile code and much more.
A task might be compiling some classes, storing class files into separate target folder, creating JAR, generating Javadoc, or publishing some achieves to the repositories.

You can also list the tasks only available in the `app` subproject by running `./gradlew :app:tasks --all`.

In <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>, we ran the `build` task using the `./gradlew build` command.

It's important to know that there are two types of tasks:

Default tasks :: the tasks available when Gradle is initialized
Custom tasks :: the user-defined tasks that perform some specific work

So far, only default tasks are listed when running `./gradlew tasks --all`.
That's because we haven't created any custom tasks.

Custom task code is typically available in the `build.gradle` file.
Here is a example `Hello World` task:
[source]
----
task welcome {
    doLast {
        println 'Welcome to the Gradle tutorial!'
    }
}
----

This custom task, if added to `build.gradle.kts` file in the `app` subproject directory, would be executed using the command `./gradlew :app:welcome`.

== Step 2. Tasks in the IDE
Let's take a look at all of the default Gradle tasks in the IntelliJ IDE.
The project should still be open following <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.

On the right hand side of your window, open the `Gradle` pane:

image::tutorial/intellij-idea-tasks.png[]

== Step 3. Run Tasks in the IDE
You can run a task in the IDE by double-clicking it in the pane.

Double-click **tutorial > app > build > build**.

image::tutorial/intellij-idea-build.png[]

It's important to make sure that the build was successful:
[source]
----
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 966ms
7 actionable tasks: 7 executed
3:18:24 AM: Execution finished 'build'.
----

== Step 4. Run Tasks in the terminal
The `jar` default task can be used to create an executable JAR file of the App.

Run the following command in your terminal:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew jar
----

A `app.jar` file is now available in your `tutorial/app/build/libs/` folder.

Invoke the `run` task and check the output:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew run

> Task :app:run
Hello World!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 436ms
----

Take a moment and read the Java source code in `tutorial/app/src/main/java/com.gradle.tutorial/App.java`:
[source,java]
----
public class App {
    public String getGreeting() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(new App().getGreeting());
    }
}
----
== Step 5. Typed Tasks
Custom and default Gradle tasks can be typed.
_Typed tasks_ are a subclass of the type link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Task.html[@Task].

This example shows a task of type `Copy`:
[source]
----
task copyTask(type: Copy) {
...
}
----

Here is another task of type `Delete`:
[source]
----
task clean(type: Delete) {
...
}
----

Popular tasks types include:

- **Copy** - `Copy` is useful to copy files around.
- **Delete** -  `Delete` is useful to delete files and directories.
- **Exec** - `Exec` is useful to execute arbitrary O/S commands.
- **Zip** - `Zip` is useful to bundle files.

Many more types are included in the DSL documentation.
