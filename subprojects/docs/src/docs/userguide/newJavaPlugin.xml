    <title>The New Java Plugin</title>

    <note>
        <para>
            The Gradle support for building Java binaries using the new model is currently <link linkend="feature_lifecycle">incubating</link>. Please be aware that the DSL and other configuration may change in later Gradle versions.
        </para>
    </note>

    <para>The New Java plugin is intended to replace the <link linkend="java_plugin">Java plugin</link>, and
        leverages the <link linkend="new_model">new model infrastructure</link>
        to acheive best performance, improved expressiveness
        and variant-aware dependency management.
    </para>

    <section>
        <title>The Software Model</title>
        <para>The plugin relies on the software model, which allows describing how an application is built, and how components
            of a model come together. The software model is organized around key concepts:
        </para>
        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>A
                    <firstterm>component</firstterm>
                    is a general concept for a piece of software, that might be deliverable. Examples of components are an standalone
                    application, a web application, a library, ... A component is often composed of other components.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>A
                    <firstterm>library</firstterm>
                    is a component which is buildable as a unit. In the Java world, a library is often assimilated to a Jar file, but while a Jar file
                    represents an output, a library is the description of how the output is built. A library is defined by the combination of its source sets and variants.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>A
                    <firstterm>source set</firstterm>
                    represents a logical group of sources for component. As such, a source set is often an input to a single
                    compilation task, which will produce an output (classes, compiled CSS, ...). A library may consist of multiple <firstterm>source sets</firstterm>.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>A
                    <firstterm>variant</firstterm>
                    represents a modulation of a component. A library, for example, might target Java 6 and Java 7, effectively producing two
                    distinct outputs: a Java 6 jar and a Java 7 jar. In this case, the target platform is an example of a <firstterm>variant dimension</firstterm>.
                    Custom library types may define their own <firstterm>variant dimensions</firstterm>, which will participate in dependency resolution.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>A <firstterm>binary</firstterm>
                    represents the output of a library. Given a combination of variants, a library may produce multiple binaries. A binary is often
                    a consumable artifact of other components.
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>To use the new Java plugin, include the following in your build script:</para>
        <sample id="newJavaQuickstart" dir="newJavaPlugin/quickstart" title="Using the new Java plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-plugin"/>
        </sample>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Creating a library</title>
        <para>A library is created by declaring a <apilink class="org.gradle.jvm.JvmLibrarySpec"/> under the <literal>components</literal>
            element of the <literal>model</literal>:
        </para>
        <sample id="newJavaQuickstart" dir="newJavaPlugin/quickstart" title="Creating a source set">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="single-lib"/>
            <output args='build' ignoreExtraLines="true"/>
        </sample>
        <para>This example creates a library named <literal>main</literal>, which will implicitly create a <firstterm>source set</firstterm>
            named <literal>java</literal>.
            Therefore the new Java plugin follows the conventions of the <link linkend="java_plugin">old Java plugin</link>, and Java sources
            are expected to be found in <filename>src/main/java</filename>,
            while resources are expected to be found in <filename>src/main/resources</filename>.
        </para>
        <para>It is possible to configure an existing <firstterm>source set</firstterm>
            through the <literal>sources</literal> container:
        </para>
        <sample id="newJavaQuickstart" dir="newJavaPlugin/quickstart" title="Configuring a source set">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="configure-sourceset"/>
        </sample>
        <para>It is also possible to create an additional source set, using the
            <apilink class="org.gradle.language.java.JavaSourceSet"/>
            type:
        </para>
        <sample id="newJavaQuickstart" dir="newJavaPlugin/quickstart" title="Creating a new source set">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="new-sourceset"/>
        </sample>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Dependencies between components</title>
        <para>The new Java plugin supports API dependencies between components. Having an API dependency means that if
            <literal>A</literal> depends on <literal>B</literal>, then the API of <literal>B</literal>
            is required to compile <literal>A</literal>. Gradle will then
            make sure that the dependency is built before the dependent component, and that the dependency
            appears on <firstterm>compile classpath</firstterm>.
            API dependencies are not transitive, and there's no runtime dependencies management solution yet.
        </para>
        <para>Currently the plugin supports two kinds of dependencies:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>dependencies onto a local project</listitem>
                <listitem>dependencies onto a local library</listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            Dependencies onto external components are not yet supported.
        </para>
        <para>Dependencies are declared on a <apilink class="org.gradle.api.tasks.SourceSet">source set</apilink>:</para>
        <sample id="newJavaMultiComponents" dir="newJavaPlugin/multiplecomponents" title="Declaring a dependency onto a library">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="simple-dependency"/>
            <output args="serverJar" outputFile="newJavaMultiComponents-serverJar.out" ignoreExtraLines="true"/>
        </sample>
        <para>This example declares an API dependency for the <literal>java</literal> source set of the <literal>server</literal> library
        onto the <literal>core</literal> library of the same project. However, it is possible for a library to be defined in a different
        project:</para>
        <sample id="newJavaMultiComponents" dir="newJavaPlugin/multiplecomponents" title="Declaring a dependency onto a project with an explicit library">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="dependency-other-project"/>
            <output args="clientJar" outputFile="newJavaMultiComponents-clientJar.out" ignoreExtraLines="true"/>
        </sample>
        <para>When the target project only defines a single library, it is possible to omit the <literal>library</literal> selector
        altogether:</para>
        <sample id="newJavaMultiComponents" dir="newJavaPlugin/multiplecomponents" title="Declaring a dependency onto a project with an implicit library">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="dependency-other-project-implicit-lib"/>
        </sample>
        <para>The <apilink class="org.gradle.platform.base.DependencySpecContainer"/> class provides a complete reference of the dependencies DSL.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Platform aware dependency management</title>
        <section>
            <title>Specifying the target platform</title>
            <para>The software model extracts the target platform as a core concept. In the Java world, it means that a library can be built, or resolved,
            against a specific version. For example, if you compile a library for Java 5, we know that such a library can be consumed by a library
            built for Java 6, but the opposite is not true. Gradle lets you define which platforms a library targets, and will take care of:</para>
            <para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>generating a binary for each target platform (eg, a Java 5 jar as well as a Java 6 jar)</listitem>
                    <listitem>resolve the dependencies against matching target platforms</listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
            </para>
            <para>Defining what platforms a library is built can be done with the <literal>targetPlatform</literal> DSL:</para>
            <sample id="newJavaTargetPlatforms" dir="newJavaPlugin/targetplatforms" title="Declaring target platforms">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="declare-target-platforms"/>
                <output args=":build" ignoreExtraLines="true"/>
            </sample>
            <para>When building the application, Gradle generates two binaries: <literal>java5MainJar</literal> and <literal>java6MainJar</literal>
            corresponding to the target versions of Java. Those are artifacts of the library that will participate in dependency resolution.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Dependency resolution</title>
            <para>When a library targets multiple versions of Java and that it depends on another library, Gradle will make its best effort to
            resolve the dependency to the most appropriate version:</para>
            <sample id="newJavaTargetPlatforms" dir="newJavaPlugin/targetplatforms" title="Declaring target platforms">
                <sourcefile file="server/build.gradle" snippet="dependency-with-platform"/>
                <output args=":server:build" ignoreExtraLines="true" outputFile="newJavaTargetPlatforms-server.out"/>
            </sample>
            <para>Gradle automatically chooses the Java 6 variant of the dependency for the Java 6 variant of the <literal>server</literal> component,
            and chooses the Java 5 version of the dependency for the Java 5 variant of the <literal>server</literal> component. In fact, Gradle chooses
            the <emphasis>highest compatible</emphasis> version of the component:</para>
            <para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>for a binary <literal>B</literal> built for Java <literal>n</literal></listitem>
                    <listitem>for a dependency binary <literal>D</literal> built for Java <literal>m</literal></listitem>
                    <listitem><literal>D</literal> is compatible with <literal>B</literal> if <literal>m&lt;=n</literal></listitem>
                    <listitem>for multiple compatible binaries <literal>D1, D2, ...Dn</literal>, choose the highest Java version</listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Custom variant resolution</title>
            <para>The Java plugin, in addition to the target platform resolution, supports resolution of custom variants. Custom variants
            can be defined on custom binary types, as long as they extends <apilink class="org.gradle.jvm.JarBinarySpec"/>. Users interested
            in testing this incubating feature can check out the documentation of the <apilink class="org.gradle.platform.base.Variant"/>
            annotation.</para>
