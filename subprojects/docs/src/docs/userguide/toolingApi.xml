    <title>The Tooling API</title>

    <section id='sec:Introduction'>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>The 1.0-milestone-3 release brought a new API, called the tooling API,
            which you can use for embedding Gradle. This API allows you to execute and monitor builds,
            and to query Gradle about the details of a build.
            The main audience for this API is IDE, CI server, other UI authors, or integration testing of your Gradle plugins.
            However, it is open for anyone who needs to embed Gradle in their application.
        </para>

        <para>A fundamental characteristic of the Tooling API is that it operates in a version independent way.
            This means that you can use the same API to work with different target versions of Gradle.
            The tooling API is Gradle wrapper aware and, by default,
            uses the same target Gradle version as that used by the wrapper-powered project.
        </para>

        <para>Some features that the tooling API provides today:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>You can query Gradle for the details of a build,
                     including the project hierarchy and the project dependencies,
                    external dependencies (including source and javadoc jars),
                     source directories and tasks of each project.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>You can execute a build, and listen to stdout and stderr logging and progress
                    (e.g. the stuff shown in the 'status bar' when you run on the command line).
                </listitem>
                <listitem>Tooling API can download and install the appropriate Gradle version, similar to the wrapper.
                    Bear in mind that the tooling API is wrapper aware so you should not need to configure gradle distribution directly.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>The implementation is lightweight, with only a small number of dependencies.
                    It is also a well-behaved library, and makes no assumptions about your classloader structure or logging configuration.
                    This makes the API easy to bundle in your application.
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>In future we may support other interesting features:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>Performance. The API gives us the opportunity to do lots of caching,
                    static analysis and preemptive work, to make things faster for the user.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>Better progress monitoring and build cancellation.
                    For example, allowing test execution to be monitored.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>Notifications when things in the build change, so that UIs and models can be updated.
                    For example, your Eclipse or IDEA project will update immediately, in the background.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>Validating and prompting for user supplied configuration.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>Prompting for and managing user credentials.
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>The Tooling API is the official and recommended way to embed Gradle.
            This means that the existing APIs, namely
            <ulink url="http://gradle.org/current/docs/javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/GradleConnector.html">GradleConnector</ulink>
            and the open API (the UIFactory and friends),
            are mildly deprecated and will be removed in some future version of Gradle.
            If you happen to use one of the above APIs, please consider changing your application to use the tooling API instead.
        </para>

        <title>Quickstart</title>
        <para>You can find some samples in <filename>$gradleHome/samples/toolingApi</filename>.
            The build files for these samples show the appropriate repository configuration
            and dependency declarations you'll need in order to use it.
            See also samples in the javadoc for
            <ulink url="http://gradle.org/current/docs/javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/GradleConnector.html">GradleConnector</ulink>,
            which is the main entry point of the API.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you're embedding gradle and you're looking for exact set of dependencies the tooling api jar requires
            please look at one of the samples at <filename>$gradleHome/samples/toolingApi</filename>.
            The dependencies are declared in the gradle build scripts.
