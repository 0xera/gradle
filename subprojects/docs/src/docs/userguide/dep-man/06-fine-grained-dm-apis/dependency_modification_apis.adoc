= Modifying dependencies before resolution

[[sec:configuration_defaults]]
== Setting default configuration dependencies

A configuration can be configured with default dependencies to be used if no dependencies are explicitly set for the configuration.
A primary use case of this functionality is for developing plugins that make use of versioned tools that the user might override.
By specifying default dependencies, the plugin can use a default version of the tool only if the user has not specified a particular version to use.

== Changing configuration dependencies prior to resolution

At times, a plugin may want to modify the dependencies of a configuration before it is resolved.
The `withDependencies` method permits dependencies to be added, removed or modified programmatically.
