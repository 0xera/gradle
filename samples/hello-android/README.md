Hello, Android!
===============

This sample demonstrates a simple Android application with a Kotlin based build script.

It has been tested against _Android Studio 3.0.1_ with the latest Kotlin plugin
from the update channel _Early Access Preview 1.2.x_.

Simply import the Gradle project by pointing to this directory.

You might need to update your _Android Support Repository_ to include the latest versions of _ConstraintLayout for Android_ and _Solver for ConstraintLayout_ as described in [this document](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/index.html#add-constraintlayout-to-your-project).
