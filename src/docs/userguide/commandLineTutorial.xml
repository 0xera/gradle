    <title>Using the Gradle Command-Line</title>
    <para>This chapter introduces the basics of the Gradle command-line. You run a build using the
        <command>gradle</command> command, which you have already seen in action in previous chapters.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Executing multiple tasks</title>
        <para>You can execute multiple tasks in a single build by listing each of the tasks on the command-line. For example,
            the command <userinput>gradle compile test</userinput> will execute the <literal>compile</literal> and
            <literal>test</literal> tasks. Gradle will execute the tasks in the order that they are listed on the
            command-line, and will also execute the dependencies for each task. Each task is executed once only,
            regardless of why it is included in the build: whether it was specified on the command-line, or it a
            dependency of another task, or both. Let's look at an example.</para>
            <para>Below three tasks are defined. Both <literal>libs</literal> and <literal>test</literal> depend on <literal>compile</literal>
            task. Execution of <userinput>gradle -q libs test</userinput> command for this build script results in <literal>compile</literal>
            task being executed only once.</para> 
        <sample id="multipleTasksFromCommandLine" dir="userguide/tutorial/multipleTasksFromCommandLine" title="Executing multiple tasks">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <output args="-q libs test"/>
        </sample>
        <para>Because each task is executed once only, executing <userinput>gradle libs libs</userinput> is exactly the same
        as executing <userinput>gradle libs</userinput>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Selecting which build to execute</title>
        <para>When you run the <command>gradle</command> command, it looks for a build file in the current directory.
            You can use the <option>-b</option> option to select another build file. For example:
        </para>
        <screen>
> gradle -b subproject/build.gradle
        </screen>
        <para>Alternatively, you can use the <option>-p</option> option to specify the project directory to use:</para>
        <screen>
> gradle -p subproject
        </screen>
    </section>
