    <title>Using Ant from Gradle</title>
    <note>
        <para>This chapter is a work in progress.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Gradle provides excellent integration with Ant. You can use individual Ant tasks or entire Ant builds in your
        Gradle builds. In fact, you will find that it's far easier and more powerful to use Ant tasks in a Gradle build
        script, than it is to use Ant's XML format. You could even use Gradle simply as a powerful Ant task scripting
        tool.
    </para>

    <para>Ant can be divided into two layers. The first layer is the Ant language. It provides the syntax for the
        <filename>build.xml</filename>, the handling of the targets, special constructs like macrodefs, and so on.
        In other words, everything except the Ant tasks and types. Gradle understands this language, and allows you to
        import your Ant <filename>build.xml</filename> directly into a Gradle project. You can then use the targets of
        your Ant build as if they were Gradle tasks.
    </para>

    <para>The second layer of Ant is its wealth of Ant tasks and types, like <literal>javac</literal>,
        <literal>copy</literal> or <literal>jar</literal>. For this layer Gradle provides integration
        simply by relying on Groovy, and the fantastic <literal>AntBuilder</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>Finally, since build scripts are Groovy scripts, you can always execute an Ant build as an external process.
        Your build script may contain statements like:<literal>"ant clean compile".execute()</literal>.
        <footnote>
            <para>In Groovy you can execute Strings. To learn more about executing external processes with Groovy have a
                look in 'Groovy in Action' 9.3.2 or at the Groovy wiki
            </para>
        </footnote>
    </para>

    <section>
        <title>Using Ant tasks and types in your build</title>

        <para>In your build script, a property called <literal>ant</literal> is provided by Gradle. This is a reference
            to an <literal>AntBuilder</literal> instance. This <literal>AntBuilder</literal> is used to
            access Ant tasks, types and properties from your build script. There is a very simple mapping from Ant's
            <filename>build.xml</filename> format to Groovy, which is explained below.
        </para>

        <para>You execute an Ant task by calling a method on the <literal>ant</literal> property. You use the task
            name as the method name. For example, you execute the Ant <literal>echo</literal> task by calling the
            <literal>ant.echo()</literal> method. The attributes of the Ant task are passed as Map parameters to the
            method. Below is an example which executes the <literal>echo</literal> task. Notice that we can also mix
            Groovy code and the Ant task markup:</para>
        <sample id="useAntTask" dir="userguide/ant/useAntTask" title="Using an Ant task">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <output args="hello"/>
        </sample>

        <para>
            You pass nested text to an Ant task by passing it as a parameter of the method call. In this example, we
            pass the message for the <literal>echo</literal> task as nested text:
        </para>
        <sample id="taskWithNestedText" dir="userguide/ant/taskWithNestedText" title="Passing nested text to an Ant task">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <output args="hello"/>
        </sample>

        <para>You pass nested elements to an Ant task inside a closure. Nested elements are defined in the same way
            as tasks. That is, by calling a method with the same name as the element we want to define.</para>
        <sample id="taskWithNestedElements" dir="userguide/ant/taskWithNestedElements" title="Passing nested elements to an Ant task">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <test args="zip"/>
        </sample>

        <para>You can access Ant types in the same way that you access tasks, by using the name of the type as the
            method name. The method call returns the Ant object, which you can then use in your build script. In the
            following example, we create an Ant <literal>path</literal> object, then iterate over the contents of it.</para>
        <sample id="useAntType" dir="userguide/ant/useAntType" title="Using an Ant type">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <test args="list"/>
        </sample>

        <para>More information about <literal>AntBuilder</literal> can be found in 'Groovy in Action' 8.4 or at the
            <ulink url="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Using+Ant+from+Groovy">Groovy Wiki</ulink>
        </para>

        <section>
            <title>Using external Ant tasks in your build</title>
            <para>You can use the <literal>typedef</literal> Ant task to define external Ant tasks, just as you would
                in a <literal>build.xml</literal> file. You can then refer to the external Ant task as you would a
                built-in Ant task.
            </para>
            <sample id="useExternalAntTask" dir="userguide/ant/useExternalAntTask" title="Using an external Ant task">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            </sample>
            <para>
                You can make use of Gradle's dependency management to assemble the classpath to use for the
                <literal>typedef</literal>. To do this, you need to define a custom configuration for the classpath, then
                add some dependencies to the configuration.
            </para>
            <sample id="useExternalAntTaskWithConfig" dir="userguide/ant/useExternalAntTaskWithConfig" title="Declaring the classpath for an external Ant task">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="define-classpath"/>
            </sample>
            <para>To use the classpath configuration, use the <literal>asPath</literal> property of the custom configuration.</para>
            <sample id="useExternalAntTaskWithConfig" dir="userguide/ant/useExternalAntTaskWithConfig" title="Using an external Ant task and dependency management together">

    <section>
        <title>Ant properties and references</title>

        <para>There are several ways to set an Ant property, so that the property can be used by Ant tasks:</para>
        <sample id="antProperties" dir="userguide/ant/properties" title="Setting an Ant property">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="set-property"/>
            <sourcefile file="build.xml" snippet="set-property"/>
        </sample>
        <para>There are several ways to get an Ant property which has been set by an Ant task:</para>
        <sample id="antProperties" dir="userguide/ant/properties" title="Getting an Ant property">
            <sourcefile file="build.xml" snippet="get-property"/>
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="get-property"/>
        </sample>
        <para>There are several ways to set an Ant reference:</para>
        <sample id="antProperties" dir="userguide/ant/properties" title="Setting an Ant reference">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="set-reference"/>
            <sourcefile file="build.xml" snippet="set-reference"/>
        </sample>
        <para>There are several ways to get an Ant reference:</para>
        <sample id="antProperties" dir="userguide/ant/properties" title="Getting an Ant reference">
            <sourcefile file="build.xml" snippet="get-reference"/>
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="get-reference"/>
        </sample>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Importing an Ant build</title>
        <para>You can use the <firstterm>Ant Plugin</firstterm> to import an Ant build into your Gradle project.
        </para>
        <sample id="antHello" dir="userguide/ant/hello" title="Importing an Ant build">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <sourcefile file="build.xml"/>
            <output args="hello"/>
        </sample>
        <para>Each Ant target is treated as a Gradle task. This means you can manipulate and execute the Ant targets in
            exactly the same way as Gradle tasks. For example, you can add a task which depends on an Ant target:
        </para>
        <sample id="dependsOnAntTarget" dir="userguide/ant/dependsOnAntTarget" title="Task that depends on Ant target">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <output args="intro"/>
        </sample>
        <para>Or, you can add behaviour to an Ant target:</para>
        <sample id="addBehaviourToAntTarget" dir="userguide/ant/addBehaviourToAntTarget" title="Adding behaviour to an Ant target">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <output args="hello"/>
        </sample>
        <para>It is also possible for an Ant target to depend on a Gradle task:</para>
        <sample id="dependsOnTask" dir="userguide/ant/dependsOnTask" title="Ant target that depends on Gradle task">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <sourcefile file="build.xml"/>
            <output args="hello"/>
        </sample>
