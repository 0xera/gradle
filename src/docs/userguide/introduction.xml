    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>We would like to introduce Gradle to you, a build system that we think is a quantum leap for build technology
        in the Java (JVM) world. Gradle provides:

        <title>About this user guide</title>
        <para>This user guide, like Gradle itself, is under very active development. Some parts of Gradle aren't
            documented as completely as they need to be. Some of the content presented won't be entirely clear or
            will assume that you know more about Gradle than you do. We need your help to improve this user
            guide. You can find out more about contributing to the documentation at the Gradle
            <ulink url="http://www.gradle.org/contributing.html">web site</ulink>.
        </para>
        <para>You can find more examples, and some additions to this user guide, on the
            <ulink url="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GRADLE/User+guide">wiki</ulink>.
            You can also contribute your own examples and extra content there.
